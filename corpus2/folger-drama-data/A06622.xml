<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>OY, there are three
thinges that make my
life miserable, a threed
bare purse, a curst wife,
&amp; a foole to my heire.
<HI>Dromio.</HI> Why then
sir, there are three medicines for these three mala∣ladies:
a pike-staffe to take a purse on the high way,
a holy wand to brush cholar frō my mistres tong,
and a young wench for my yong master: so that as
your Worship being wise begot a foole, so he bee∣ing
a foole may tread out a wise man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Memp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I but <HI>Dromio,</HI> these medicines bite hot
on great mischiefs, for so might I haue a rope about
my necke, hornes vpon my head, and in my house
a litter of fooles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then sir you had best let some wise man sit
on your sonne, to hatch him a good wit: they saie,
<PB REF="4"/>
if rauens sit on hens egs the chickens will be black,
and so forth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Memp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why boy, my sonne is out of the shell,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Memp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rascall, doest thou imagine thy mistres
naught of her bodie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but fantasticall of her mind, and it may
be, when this boy was begotten shee thought of a
foole, &amp; so conceiued a foole, your selfe beeing ve∣rie
wise, and she surpassing honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mem.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be, for I haue heard of an Aethio∣pian,
that thinking of a faire picture, brought forth
a faire ladie, and yet no bastard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drom.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are well read sir, your sonne may be

<P>Then boy hast thou a quicke wit, and I a

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marie either you would haue your wiues
tong in your sons head, that he might bee a prating
foole, or his braines in hir brain pan, that she might
be a foolish scold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dreamst <HI>Dromio,</HI> there is no such
matter, thou knowest I haue kept him close, so that
my neighbors thinke him to be wise, and her to be
temperate, because they neuer heard them speake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou knowest that <HI>Stellio</HI> hath a good farme

should by some roisting courtier be stollen away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So sir.</P>

<SP>

<P>Now if I could compasse a match between

vs parents, and without theirs, I should be blessed▪
he coosned, and thou for euer set at libertie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>A singular conceit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus much for my sonne. Nowe for my
wife, I would haue this kept from her, else shal I not
be able to keepe my house from smoake, for let it
come to one of her eares, &amp; then wo to both mine:
I would haue her goe to my house into the Coun∣trie
whilest we conclude this, and this once done, I
care not if her tong neuer haue done: these if thou
canst effect, thou shalt make thy master happie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thinke it done, this noddle shall coin such
new deuice as you shall haue your sonne marryed
py to morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mem.</SPEAKER>
<P>But take heed, that neither the father nor
the maide speak to my sonne, for then his folly will
marre all.</P>

<P>Lay all the eare on mee, <HI>Subleuabo te onere,</HI> I

<P>Wilt thou rid me for a foole?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tush, quarrell not.</P>

<P>Then for the dowrie, let it bee at least two

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let vs in, that I may furnish thee with
some better counsell, and my sonne with better ap∣parell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone, I lacke but a wagge more to
make of my counsell, and then you shall see an ex∣quisite
coosnage, &amp; the father more foole than the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay <HI>Riscio,</HI> she is no natural foole, but in this

<P>Wel, then this Ile tel thee friendly, I haue al∣most

I haue heard to be verie faire, and know shal be ve∣rie
rich, she is his heire, he doats, he is stooping old,
and shortly must die, yet by no meanes, either by
blessing or cursing can I win my sonne to be a wo∣er,
which I know proceeds not of bashfulnesse but
stubbornnesse, for hee knowes his good though I

<P>Stay <HI>Sperantus,</HI> this is like my case, for I haue
bene tampering as long to haue a marriage cōmit∣ted

they saie he is as goodly a youth as one shall see in a
Summers daie, and as neate a stripling as euer went
on neats leather, his father will not let him be forth
<PB REF="7"/>
of his sight, he is so tender ouer him, he yet lies with
his mother for catching cold. Now my pretie else,
as proud as the day is long, she wil none of him, she
forsooth wil choose her owne husband, made mar∣riages
proue mad marriages, shee will choose with
her eie and like with her heart before she consent
with her tong, neither father nor mother, kith nor
kin shalbe her caruer in a husband, shee will fall too
where she likes best, and thus the chicke scarce out

<P>Parents in these daies are growen pieuish,
they rocke their children in their cradles till they

what will you giue with your daughter? What
Ioynter will you make for your sonne? And many
a match is broken off for a penie more or lesse, as
though they could not afford their children at such
a price, when none should cheapen such ware, but
affection, and none buy it but loue.</P>

<P>In deed our parents take great care to make
vs aske blessing and say grace when as we are lyttle
ones, and growing to yeeres of iudgement they de∣priue
vs of the greatest blessing, and the most graci∣us
things to our mindes, the libertie of our minds:
they giue vs pap with a spoon before we can speak,
and when wee speake for that wee loue, pap with a
hatchet: because their fansies beeing growen mu∣sty
with hoarie age, therefore nothing can relish in
their thoughtes that sauours of sweet youth: they
studie twentie yeeres together to make vs grow as
straight as a wande, and in the ende by bowing vs
make vs as crooked as a cammocke. For mine owne
part (sweet <HI>Candius)</HI> they shall pardon me, for I will
measure my loue by min owne iudgement, not my
fathers purse or peeuishnes. Nature hath made me
his child, not his slaue, I hare <HI>Memphio</HI> and his son

<P>And my minion hath wrought well, where
euery stitch in her sampler is a pricking stitch at my
heart: you take your pleasure on parents, they are
peeuish, fooles, churles, ouergrowen with igno∣rance,
because ouerworne with age, litle shalt thou
know the case of a father before thy selfe be a mo∣ther,
when thou shalt breed thy childe with conti∣nuall
paines, and bringing it foorth with deadly
pangs, nurse it with thine owne paps, and nourish it
vp with motherly tendernes, and then finde them
to curse thee with their hearts, when they shoulde
aske blessing on their knees, and the collop of thine
owne bowels to be the torture of thine owne soul,
with teares trickling downe thy checkes, and drops
of bloud falling from thy heart, thou wilt in vtte∣ring
of thy minde wish them rather vnborne than
vnnatural, &amp; to haue had their cradles their graues
<PB REF="10"/>
rather than thy death their bridals. But I will not
dispute what thou shouldst haue done, but correct
what thou hast done, I perceiue sowing is an idle
exercise, and that euerie daie there come more
thoughtes into thine head, than stitches into thy
worke, Ile see whether you can spin a better mind
than you haue stitched, and if I coope you not vp,
then let me be the capon.</P>

<P>As for you sir boy, in stead of poaring on a

reape what wantonnesse hath sowen, but we
are both well serued, the sonnes must bee masters,
the fathers gaffers, what wee get together with a
rake, they cast abroade with a forke, and wee must
wearie our legges to purchase our children armes.
Well, seeing that booking is but idlenesse, Ile see
whether threshing be anie occupation, thy minde
shall stoope to my fortune, or mine shall break the
lawes of nature. How like a micher he standes, as
though he had trewanted from honestie, get thee
in, and for the rest let me alone. In villaine.</P>

honorable pages with hats of mustard on their heades,
himselfe in greate pompe sitting vppon a cushion
of white Brewish, linde with browne Breade,
<PB REF="25"/>
me thought being poudred he was much trobled with
the salt rume, &amp; therfore there stood by him two great
flagons of sacke and beere, the one to drie vp his rume,
the other to quench his cholar, <HI>I</HI> as one enuying his
ambition, hungring and thirsting after his honor, began
to pull his cushiō frō vnder him, hoping by that means
to giue him a fall, &amp; with putting out my hand awakt, &amp;
found nothing in all this dreame about me but the salt

that there were a whole handfull of curants to be araig∣ned
of a riot, because they clūged together in such clu∣sters,
twelue raisons of the sunne were impannelled in
a Iewry, and as a leafe of whole mase which was bailief
was carrying the quest to consult, me thought ther came
an angrie cooke, and gelded the Iewry of theyr stones,
<PB REF="25"/>
and swept both iudges, iurers, rebels and bailiefe into

brother and sister, which I reioyced at, but at length too
forward in affection, which although inwardly <HI>I</HI> could
not mislike, yet openly I seemed to disallowe: they in∣creased
in their louing humours, <HI>I</HI> ceased not to cha∣stise
them for theyr loose demeanors, at last it came to

was a foole, that my daughter with Stellio was also vn∣wise,
