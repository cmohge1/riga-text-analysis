<L>Y'are all most welcome to no vulgar Play;</L>
<L>And so farre we are confident; And if he</L>
<L>That made it, still lives in your memory;</L>
<L>You will expect what we present to night,</L>
<L>Should be judg'd worthy of your eares and sight.</L>
<L>You shall heare <HI>Fletcher</HI> in it; his true straine,</L>
<L>And neate expressions; living he did gaine</L>
<L>Your good opinions; But now dead commends</L>
<L>This Orphan to the care of noble friends:</L>
<L>And may it raise in you content and mirth,</L>
<L>And be receiv'd for a legitimate birth.</L>
<L>Your grace erects new Trophies to his fame,</L>

<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<L>From this idlenesse</L>
<L>Diseases both in body and in minde</L>
<L>Grow strong upon you; where a stirring nature</L>
<L>With wholsome exercise guards both from danger:</L>
<L>I'de have thee rise with the Sunne, walke, daunce, or hunt,</L>
<L>Visite the groves and springs, and learne the vertues</L>
<L>Of Plants and Simples: Doe this moderately,</L>
<L>And thou shalt not with eating chalke, or coales,</L>
<L>Leather and oatmeale, and such other trash,</L>
<L>Fall into the greene sicknesse.</L>

<L>What is it <HI>Sylvia?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syl.</SPEAKER>
<L>What i'st? A noble Husband; In that word, a</L>
<L>Noble Husband, all content of Woman</L>
<L>Is wholly comprehended; He will rowse her,</L>
<L>As you say, with the Sunne, and so pipe to her,</L>
<L>As she will daunce, ne're doubt it, and hunt with her,</L>
<L>Upon occasion, untill both be weary;</L>
<L>And then the knowledge of your Plants and Simples,</L>
<L>As I take it, were superfluous; A loving,</L>

<L>And who gave you Commission to deliver</L>
<L>Your verdict, Minion?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syl.</SPEAKER>
<L>I deserve a fee,</L>
<L>And not a frowne, deare Madam; I but speake</L>
<L>Her thoughts, my Lord, and what her modesty</L>
<L>Refuses to give voyce to; Shew no mercy</L>
<L>To a Maidenhead of fourteene, but off with 't:</L>
<L>Let her loose no time Sir, fathers that deny</L>
<L>Their Daughters lawfull pleasure, when ripe for them,</L>
<L>In some kindes edge their appetites to taste of</L>
<L>The fruit that is forbidden.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tis well urg'd,</L>
<L>And I approve it; no more blushing Girle,</L>
<L>Thy woman hath spoke truth, and so prevented</L>
<L>What I meant to move to thee: There dwelles neere us</L>
<L>A Gentleman of blood, Monsieur <HI>Brisac,</HI></L>
<L>Of a faire state, sixe thousand Crownes <HI>per annum,</HI></L>
<L>The happy Father of two hopefull Sonnes,</L>
<L>Of different breeding; Th'elder, a meere Scholar,</L>
<L>The younger, a queint Courtier.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, I know them</L>
<L>By publique fame, though yet I never saw them;</L>
<L>And that oppos'd antipathy betweene</L>
<L>Their various dispositions, renders them</L>
<L>The generall discourse and argument;</L>
<L>One part inclining to the Scholar <HI>Charles,</HI></L>
<L>The other side preferring <HI>Eustace,</HI> as</L>
<L>A man compleat in Courtship.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<L>And which way</L>
<L>(If of these two you were to chuse a husband)</L>
<L>Doth your affection sway you?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<L>To be plaine, Sir,</L>
<L>(Since you will teach me boldnesse) As they are</L>
<L>Simply themselves, to neither; Let a Courtier</L>
<L>Be never so exact, Let him be blest with</L>
<L>All parts that yeeld him to a Virgin gracious,</L>
<L>If he depend on others, and stand not</L>
<L>On his owne bottomes, though he have the meanes</L>
<L>To bring his Mistresse to a Masque, or by</L>
<L>Conveyance from some great ones lippes, to taste</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Such favour from the kings; or grant he purchase,</L>
<L>Precedency in the Country, to be sworne</L>
<L>A servant Extraordinary to the Queene;</L>
<L>Nay, though he live in expectation of</L>
<L>Some huge preferment in reversion; If</L>
<L>He Want a present fortune, at the best</L>
<L>Those are but glorious dreames, and onely yeeld him</L>
<L>A happinesse in <HI>posse,</HI> not in <HI>esse;</HI></L>
<L>Nor can they fetch him silkes from th'Mercer; nor</L>
<L>Discharge a Taylors bill; nor in full plenty</L>
<L>(Which still preserves a quiet bed at home)</L>
<L>Maintaine a family.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aptly consider'd,</L>
<L>And to my wish, but what's thy censure of</L>
<L>The Scholar?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<L>Troth (if he be nothing else)</L>
<L>As of the Courtier; all his Songs, and Sonnets,</L>
<L>His Anagrams, Acrosticks, Epigrammes,</L>
<L>His deepe and Philosophicall discourse</L>
<L>Of natures hidden secrets, makes not up</L>
<L>A perfect husband; He can hardly borrow</L>
<L>The Starres of the Celestiall crowne to make me</L>
<L>A tire for my head; nor <HI>Charles</HI> Waine for a Coach,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Ganimede</HI> for a Page, nor a rich gowne</L>
<L>From <HI>Juno's</HI> Wardrobe, nor would I lye in</L>
<L>(For I despaire not once to be a mother)</L>
<L>Under heavens spangled Canopy, or banquet</L>
<L>My guests and Gossips with imagin'd Nectar,</L>
<L>Pure <HI>Orleans</HI> would doe better; no, no, father,</L>
<L>Though I could be well pleas'd to have my husband</L>
<L>A Courtier, and a Scholar, young, and valiant,</L>
<L>These are but gawdy nothings, If there be not</L>
<L>Something to make a substance.</L>

<L>That gallant <HI>Eustace,</HI> (I meane, now he dares fight)</L>

<L>Insufferable wrongs, and justly sleighted,</L>
<L>By yeelding to a minute of delay</L>
