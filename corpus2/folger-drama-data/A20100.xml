it might be one of you) were inuited to the Reuells one night
at one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Court: the husband (hauing businesse)
trusts his wife thither to take vp a roome for him before: shee
did so: but before shee went; doubts a rising, what blockes
her husband would stumble at, to hinder his entrance, It was
consulted vpon, by what token, by what trick,, by what ban∣ner,
or brooch he should bee knowne to bee hee when hee
wrapt at the Gate:</P>

he himselfe therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an excellent watch-word, and the

he would wind his horne, and that should giue 'hem warning

to receaiue him: he comes, ringes out his horne with an alla∣rum,
enters with a showte, all the house rises (thinking some
sowgelder prest in) his wife blusht, the company Iested, the sim∣ple
man like a begger going to the stocks laught, as not being
sencible of his own disgrace, &amp; hereupon the punyes set downe
this decre that no man shall hereafter come to laugh at their
