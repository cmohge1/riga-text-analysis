<L><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG> Some back againe, this way my selfe will take,</L>
<L>And as you goe, call those chaster wood-men</L>
<L>To your aide, who often helpe us in the chace,</L>
<L>Mingle with every step a call, and if</L>
<L>An eccho but resound her name, utter't</L>
<L> Againe, untill y'are confirm'd.</L>
<STAGE>Exeunt two of the Nimphes.</STAGE>
<L>I've lost a <HI>Nimph</HI> in whom I gloried more</L>
<L>Then all those prouder Trophyes to my name,</L>
<L>She excell'd in Fame, in Birth, in Beauty,</L>
<L>And being Patronesse of her, well I might</L>
<L>Be cal'd the goddesse of Strict Chastity.</L>
<L>She was her selfe a guard unto her selfe,</L>
<L>Her Beauty so commanding good, did keepe</L>
<L>Her chastity; and her chastity, made</L>
<L>Her beauty safe, lust might sooner gaze to</L>
<L>Virtue in her eyes, then spie one of its</L>
<L>Knowne Deformities. —</L>
<STAGE>Enter Juno.</STAGE>
<L>And much I feare, some Satyre, or worse power</L>
<L>Hath betray'd her innocent Stepps, and now</L>
<L>Detaines her, adoring yet what he meanes</L>
<L>To spoile, or <HI>Jove</HI> againe in some various</L>
<L>Shape of Love, wrongs both his Deity, and me —</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juno.</SPEAKER>
<L>And why bright <HI>Phoebe,</HI> may not a more</L>
<L>Equall Love. <HI>Endimion, Hippolitus,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Juno</HI> on the earth?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juno.</SPEAKER>
<L>But this thoughts too likely, and to common</L>
<L>To be entertained: you thinke if ought be</L>
<L>Lost, it must be lost a farre, passe <HI>Hymen's</HI></L>
<L>Temple that borders on your groves, and search</L>
<L>The Caves. Nay beleeve heaven's a neerer</L>
<L>Enemy, if <HI>Jove</HI> doe court her tis in</L>
<L>The shape of <HI>Ganimede,</HI> for such was hee</L>
<L>That led her from your traine. But turne and prove</L>
<L>How much y'are lost in feares, not she in love.</L>
<L>See in this glorious perspective, where sits</L>
<L>Your so deplored Nymph, and the lovely Satyr</L>
<L>That insnar'd her. Can you 'gainst his nobler</L>
<L>Brest bend a dart? or wish it thither?</L>
<L>See where <HI>Cupid</HI> stands, and laughes, ready</L>
<L>In his just offence, if you shoote, to shoote</L>
<L>Another. Tempt him not at so great ods,</L>
<L>Oft times such beauty hath inflam'd the gods.</L>
<L>It seemes you little deale in marriages,</L>
<L>That could be so ignorant of this day,</L>
<L>Then which, none was ever more expected,</L>
<L>More proclaim'd. This was no midnight bargaine,</L>
<L>Nor stolne match: but like unto the lovers,</L>
<L>Knowne and eminent. First, by their Parents</L>
<L>Thought on and concluded who were not sad</L>
<L>Judges, but Prophets of their after loves,</L>
<L>Then deferrd till <HI>Minerva</HI> had inrich'd</L>
<L>The one, and your purer Lawes the other.</L>
<L>And last of all, when in this high manner,</L>
<L>Fame with her lowdest blast had askst the bonds,</L>
<L>And none was found so boldly bad, nor proudly</L>
<L>Envious to intrude, joynd they were by the</L>
<L>Sacred hand of Majesty.</L>
<L>Why droopes <HI>Diana</HI>?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus daily to behold the noblest of my traine</L>
<L>Snatcht from me, and <HI>Hymens</HI> torch out-shine the</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juno.</SPEAKER>
<L>This day your power is not diminisht, her</L>
<L>Name, and not her Chastity is lost; shee's</L>
<L>Onely chaing'd from a pure virgine, to as</L>
<L>Pure a Bride.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Diana.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet it joyes me to see</L>
<L>My feares thus ended.</L>

<L>Of sorrow ore the day.</L>
<L>From these solemnities be farre away,</L>

<SPEAKER>Trage.</SPEAKER>
<L>How much Divinest <HI>Juno</HI> speakes below</L>
<L>Her selfe, in preferring what she must scorne</L>
<L>To name. Can shee desire to doe something</L>
<L>In honour of this assembly? something,</L>
<L>As when the gods are pleasd, and wish to see it</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>In so low a Straine? entertaine Princes?</L>
<L>And in Comedies poore vaine? would she have</L>
<L>An Epithalamion in these Lovers praise.</L>
<L>And heare it chanted in rude roundelayes?</L>
<L>As all prophane. Let these be farre away</L>
<L>Unworthy in this night to beare a part,</L>
<L>What a mockery would such be of their</L>
<L>Noble Love, to have its pure name smothered</L>
<L>By so grosse a fire? their brave actions</L>
<L>Parralel'd with such country Jiggs, of <HI>Cupid,</HI></L>
<L>Ridiculously immitating with</L>
<L>Their long passions? No, if <HI>Juno</HI> do</L>
<L>Desire to crowne these houres above the rest,</L>
<L>And make 'em welcome, yet before the best</L>
<L>These doe enjoy, through peace, and innocence</L>
<L>Let her performe something that's god-like, they</L>
<L>Which are happy need noe shewes of mirth. Their</L>
<L>State is Comedy enough, sportes doe not fit</L>
<L>This night but glory. If't be haeroicke,</L>
<L>Then 'tis opposite, which makes me offer</L>
<L>Thus my service, as most due to me, to</L>
<L>Shew the will, that speakes the language of the</L>
<L>Gods, and as I am thus taxt with blood, and</L>
<L>Crewelty, 'tis not my lines that wounds them</L>
<L>But their faults represent.</L>
<L>And though they are with vice, and fate opprest</L>
<L>Yet those which see a Tragedy, are blest.</L>

<L>The powers, that formerly vouchsaf't to tie</L>

<SPEAKER>Com.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, none Sir, hees mirth it selfe, and the cause of it in others, they say all pleasure is a shadow, then that which wee enjoy is but the shadow of a shadow, hardly the Picture of what he imbraces; our Delights are faint, thwarted by the Conscience, started with feares, and after an hower of pleasure a weeke of repentance; in which time wee live by rule, and not by custome, laugh not though the jest bee good, nor rage though at a just cause; but sickly whisper out our sayings, as though they were our last and eate our chickens with the curtaines drawne, when the Foole lusts with his whole soule too, and sinnes till hee's weary, knowes no Conscience but his want that way; nor remorse but disability.</P>

<P>Nature never shewed her liberality more than to those she was sparing of her best gifts to, shee houses wisedome in a body full of decayes, and requires her whole strength to beare off the ruine, measures his legges with the spiders, gives him pale and wan lookes, scarce altered from the earth hee was made of, where to the Ideot she bestowes a body equall with the bulke of trees, and armes as Thunder-proofe, makes him a strong, a large, and healthy foole.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Lordship is one of those which say their Prayers backward for the State, and ends in black wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the Foxes that thrive by it.</P>
<P><HI>Phro. Aratus</HI> your anger is unseasonable, and the King marks it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now <HI>Aratus,</HI> whats the matter? our table should know no frownes, then least of all when we our selfe forbeares them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Royall Sir I aske your pardon, hee wakt mee something rudely, and got a froward answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, all dead, fill another round, our wine moves not,
<PB REF="6"/>
here <HI>Polyander,</HI> to thee, what thinkst thou of <HI>Comastes</HI> happines?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thinke Sir, 'tis as dull as foolish, there cannot bee a sence of pleasure, where there is so little sence. Greatnesse is the center of all happinesse, and felicity like our lands, at first is ty∣ed to the Crowne, kings come nere unto the gods, and are like them both in power and pleasure, doe command all, enjoy all, are miserable onely in too much, and want but what to wish for, this is the dazeling happinesse. Tis vaine therefore to pre∣ferre private joyes before the Crowne-pleasures, the King may throw by his greatnesse when he please, and be poorely happy, the beggar will nere sigh unto a Scepter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I <HI>Polyander</HI> ther's some life in this, a little heaven even in the apprehension. <HI>Aratus</HI> art not thou of this opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not I Sir, nor of my Lord the Foole's there,</L>
<L>Kings are more miserable than they seeme</L>
<L>Happy, flattered by themselves and others</L>
<L>Into a Ioy that is not, and what they</L>
<L>Feele, they rather doe beleeve, than finde so.</L>
<L>Yet I grant too, a King may be happy</L>
<L>But never as a King. Felicity</L>
<L>Is a purchase, and no inheritance,</L>
<L>Nor hath the prerogative more than one</L>
<L>Life in't neither, it dies still with the buyer,</L>
<L>Troubles are the good kings profession,</L>
<L>In the warres the first dart is throwne at him,</L>
<L>Where his happinesse is in a glorious death,</L>
<L>Or else his God-like rayes pluckt from him</L>
<L>By some accursed hand, and so falls lesse</L>
<L>Happie, being but wishd so by a poore</L>
<L>Revenge hee knowes not.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Very grave and unseasonable, thus your Lordship gets the reputation of singularity, which the vulgar suspect to be wisedome.</P>

<L>Rather thou hadst answered me with a blow,</L>

<L>Something, but I see thou art unworthy</L>
<L>Of a brave demand. Thy skill lies onely</L>
<L>In the curiosity of a meale.</L>
<L>To say at the first touch a th tongue, this is</L>
<L>A Chian, this a Falernian wine.</L>
<L>Streight by the colour of the flesh to know</L>

<L>When this Bore was slaine? were not these apples</L>
<L>Pulld the Moone increasing? Degenerate,</L>
<L>I have seene thee put thy face into a frowne,</L>
<L>And wer't so constant in that looke, as if</L>
<L>Thou hadst no other.</L>

<L>A Kingdome, a Prince, a Law, so large</L>
<L>The extents are, nere did plot thrive like it:</L>

<L>Like some unheard of new opinions</L>
<L>Streigthned at first, and prisoned in the brests</L>
<L>Of two or three, gaines strength by time, and eares,</L>
<L>And dayly fed by curiosity,</L>
<L>Thrusts out at last the old and most receiv'd,</L>
<L>And growes the whole religion of the place.</L>
<L>When we have calld our party forth, the worke</L>
<L>Will seeme done, the thinne numbers which are left</L>
<L>Not deserving the name of enemies.</L>

I alwaies use to petition with it, tis bigger than any of his owne, and pleasd him a∣bove measure; the first time hee saw it, hee commended the largenesse of my minde, and said it was a noble emulation in mee: hee has a Daughter Sir, a beautifull Lady, my hopes, unlesse some neighbour Prince doe reele betwixt us, your Grace comes the right way, hee hates a dry Inland traveller, but that you kisse the cup, and have too much bounce, and downe with him in you, which were things hee surseited on some fifteene yeares since, and still the very names turne his

<P>The scurviest entertainment, I did not thinke it pos∣sible so short a time could have prepared one so ill, 'twas thought on before, and paines taken to order it so much for the worse: This was the first day that e're me thoughts the King and my Lord <HI>Timeus</HI> lookt like the Father and the Sunne, The King had on his old councell face, which all hope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had forgot and this was the only time these many yeeres he should not have worne it, they both embrac'd the Stranger, as cold, and carelessely as if they had beene to fight after, this behavi∣our in the great ones, was presently observed like a new fashion, and in an instant the whole traine was in, from the bravest to those which follow a fashion onely, when tis to leave off something, and then looke not as if they were hot: but wanting a cloake. Marry their wit's were not so change∣able, as their faces, and having but one Sure of Complement, and that now unfashonable, they were faine to supply it with Leggs, and Silence.</P>

<PB REF="15"/>
expected, I found the Prince all alone where any body might have seene him for nothing, the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and the <HI>Trojan</HI> Captaines in the hangings were all his company, with whom hee seem'd well suited, had they beene alive his lookes were as challinging as theirs, and standing so, bred much comparison.</P>

Hee sayes to sleepe because the day is gon, is to performe a duty not a ne∣cessity, and to eate at a certaine houre to satisfie the time, and not his hunger. Nature is the Mistris of his faculties and no custome, which are rude and stubborne and will admit not Lawes but what themselves enact, nor stricktly observe them neyther. Tis a strange distraction for 16. yeares, a deeper dis∣content possesses him then doth the memories of those, which have runne the miseryes, and sinnes of a long life.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you understand it right, there is a Religion towards, and I may truely say that this our
<PB REF="24"/>
private meeting and close Counsell is more just, and glo∣rious then the lowdest deede in Court, that all our pub∣like Acts, edicts, and formes of Law, are darke and impious compared to it; nay, that this time and place made holy by our purposes hath the gods more manifest and present, then the Sacrifice and Temples, long since made void and empty of a Deity, by those which sue for favours and request for him, who justly heare deserves their horridst vengeance, we are not met heere to plot a generall ruine for a private injury, we know and teach the greatest <HI>Donne</HI> by the King unto the Subject, can not give him cause to throw off his faith. Kings are petty gods and may tempt us, nor is it want or desire of Innovation that thus Stirreth us, wee are in the best ill State allready, nor ambition to Strike at that Law∣rell which the Thunder spares, no we reverence it, and know that as men are the workes of nature, so Kings of <HI>Jove.</HI> But 'tis our oath the Sacrament we tooke, which still holds us though our Lord be dead, untill his successor doe quit us from it, by taking of a new one, we are not subjects, but slaves to him we now obey, and therefore as slaves we ought to hate our Master; he was borne lesse then we, and hides the private man under the publique gowne; the purple which he weares was dipt deepe in the blood of Innocents to collour't so. But I vainely wast my selfe in words, here are no minds to be perswaded, nor eares to be instructed; the sinnes we are to punish, we all know, and the gods remem∣ber, our Strength then is all we are to speake of, which is the greatest halfe of the Jsle 16. yeares undisturb'd pro∣vision, so carelesly was that provided for which was got by blood, there is but one Lordship, small in respect of others, the Tyrants owne possession that will stand strong for him, but they are so besotted with their fortunes that their greatest aide will be but in their will to doe him service. They may offer up their lives, like so many Sacrifices for his sake, but not like Souldiers, they are unworthy of that name: They may dy but never conquer, warr is never talk't of but in their banquets, nor dare they fight beyond a Brawle.</P>

<P>And if we would count part of our Strength in their weaknesse, we have no opposition. In the City where
<PB REF="24"/>
they and their vices are daily seene, nothing is to contemptible; and in the remoter parts, where Majestie is no more reve∣renc'd, being knowne onely by the Power and lawes, and where the name of King heares like the name of God, even there those sonnes of the earth (as I may so call them) dare mi∣nace at him, and pile hills on hills to set their bodies equall to their hates.</P>

<P>Royall Sir you are wellcome. Start not at the name, it is your due, you were borne to that title, and I doubt not, though you never heard it thus applide before, tis not altoge∣ther a Stranger to you, there was a sparke which in the first wombe after a speciall manner was insufd into you, and is as another soule within you, as the one informes your body, so this informes that soule, we may call it the difference of a King, that will tell you we are all heere your subjects, and this no strange Phylosophy I teach, and though this rich per∣sume hath hitherto beene wrapt in this disguise of learning, and defended from the aire oth court, tis not decayde, but growne stronger by such keeping, which when it shall bee opened will cast a fragrant smell ore all the Kingdome, and cure the infections of the former age; to open it we are met, it is a me∣dicine we too long have languishd for. And Sir, though it bee a short warning to so great a matter, you must presently pre∣parè to bee a King; wee have no time now to instruct you in your right, and how you lost it, it was yeares a doing, and will require yeares for to relate it.

Then they clothed mee in a body, foule as the Tra∣gedy I was to act, and made me dote on those deformities which all did loath, when they had bewitcht mee with these false, yet glittering names, and I obeyed their blacke commands, in a moment they changd into Repentance, a mournefull figure: and sadly left mee as they first did find

<P>Yet, I had a cause (Pardon me that I say) and being that I saw not you before I did it, a iust one. I lost a Sove∣raigne, as nere to me in blood, as love; and if this cause may seeme remote, I had a father murdered, whose death, as it be∣comes you thus to mourne, so it did mee for to revenge, my selfe was banisht, loyaltie was both our faults, and when they had heapt these sorrowes on me, left mee not one hope to leane on; they were not yet content with my despaire, but sought my life, which was so poore, it could not be distinguisht then from death; their injuries forcd a new one in mee, and blew the sparke untill the flame consumde 'um. But had I be∣held you before their danger, it would have turnd my soule within mee, changd mee from a Foe unto their partie. I cannot now beleeve I had a Justice, that there could bee any where you were iniurd in it, so much my love doth mount above my griefe, that it makes mee thinke I have onely lost your father. Why weepe you thus? Could that recall him, I'de beare you company, and breake those stub∣borne gates, which from my childe-hood to this present houre hath kept them backe, and spend my whole store here. But nothing can redeeme him, let that common reme∣dy which all apply, and helpeth all, give ease unto you, that nothing can redeeme him.

<P>Tis so to both of us. And we will ever celebrate it, as the first day that we were borne Brother and Sister, before we were Strangers, now we are twinns of love. My Lord, I un∣derstand the holy League betwixt you, and though I lay my hand thus on it, I Intend not for to breake it, nor make a di∣vorse, though thus I part you: pardon me that I seeme covetous of so great a happines; and shew a loathnes to part from it, be∣fore I have my selfe enjoyed it.

<P>It were a creuelty to wish it other, I will not be guilty of such desires, if after a brother, I an humble servant shall be thought on, 'tis the time and place I am ambitious off.

<P>O my Lord, say not so, though I am kinde I am not fond, I'le give up my interest, or any thing rather then you shall leave us; I spoke it as a meanes to stay you make it not then a parting word: helpe me to perswade him.</P>

<P>Tis enough, I obey, my busines is much below my love, and I will rather distroy the one, then offend the other, yet now I have granted I'le intreat againe, as for a new favour. I may perswade, though deny nothing. My voyage was bound to another place, before happily I was cast upon this shore, and though I call my selfe a Prince, I am a servant to my imploy∣ments, and obey the Commission of a Father, the expence, and expectation of a Kingdome,</P>

<P>S<SUP>r</SUP>, I bow to you. But that which is my greife will be noe longer mine alone, then while I doe conceale it, all that hears't will also have their share in it, 'tis a disease that good men catch meerely by the fantasy. Justice could never yet with all her care so carue out her punishment, but that the In∣nocent were wounded with the blow, and felt the Judgement of another sinne, while with her Sword she cuts off the offen∣ding parent the child is made an Orphan in the Cradle, and mournes hereafter because he had noe fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Whether doth this sad beginning tend?</P>

<P>To this S<SUP>r</SUP>, as we have slaine withall religion a bloody tyrant, one that was greater in his sinnes then in the King∣dome he purchast by them. So too we have causelesse slayne the father of a Lady, that knew not so much guilt as to satisfie
<PB REF="47"/>
her, why shee lost him: for want of whose life she now con∣temnes her owne, a Jewell of inestimable value with all that does behold it but her selfe, S<SUP>r</SUP>, you cannot call her an enemy, though her goodnesse hath stood against you, and preserved her Father so many yeeres in spite of all his sinnes, she ought to resist all piety if it were an enemy to her owne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her cause of greife is mighty, and if care be not taken, as their faults have donne the rest, her goodnesse will distroy her, we that beheld the past deformities, can beare witnes of her virtues, she was the only mine of honour, and when we have beene wearyed in seeking one graine, in her we could finde a treasure, nor wast a beauty set of onely with the blemishes of others, or foild by generall vices, but a reall, and a native excellence, which as it could not be obscured with thickest darkenesse: so neyther could it be outshind by other lights.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her greife concernes us all, and ought to be considered before our joyes, beare these teares to her, we wish the ex∣cesse of ours may lessen her's, and say that comfort which is left we will preserve, and carefully offer to her. Her brother with many of her friends are fled unto the Fort, and are there shut up — would I could give them life, what say you my Lord? may I doe this? Is not mercy in this place folly?</P>

I shall but curse the givers of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pall.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I thought so, I'de grant to your request, and kill you; I could doe it, I have strength, and justice enough to make me able, but you are not so bad, as you suppose, these are dispairing, and not malitious thoughts; yet ere I goe one way or other Ile give you satisfaction, I came for that intent. Let me see your Articles —</P>
<STAGE>Hee seemes to read them to himselfe, and speakes out the last.</STAGE>
<P>And if these may not be granted, that thus accompanied, wee may depart the Isle. How poore are these requests? without more commission I dare grant you greater. Why, these are de∣mands within the compasse of a subjects breast, deceive not your selves, you were not so safe in your owne raigne, as in your e∣nemies. The State is not translated from one tyranny to another, but to a kingdome. A Prince governes now, which is the name of mercy, as well as power, w<SUP>ch</SUP> he truly knowes, and in his first deeds desires to shew on you; he does not thinke he's then like Iove when he can thunder, but when he can hold it in, not when he is the voice of death, but when he sits harmelesse, with the power of death about him. Revenge, Torments, Executions, are not expressions of a king, but a distruction, he rivalls not the im∣mortall powers in Temples, statues, adoration, but transcendent
<PB REF="49"/>
virtues, divine performances, these are the additions by which he climbes heaven, and appeares a god on earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I bee a stranger to these virtues, more than this man? I was not borne for lesse things than he, certain∣ly when nature made this frame, she intended it for the noblest actions.</P>

<P>If you will goe on, I can heare you still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will goe on in mercy, tis my commission, and if you will not dam against its streames, it may flow to you: yet the way is even; why looke you strangely at the word? tis no wonder to the sender of it, nor they which live about him. Though the dangers may seeme great, twere not worthy of the high name of his mercy, if the offence were not such. This is but the least of his expressions, that his enemies were courted for to live, but presently you thinke tis not to save you, but to deferre your death. A vaine thought, when can it be done more safely, and more justly, you are now as farre from those to help you, as to pity you. None but himselfe has any care of you. Tis true, there is a Lady that had a share in you, but with your honor you threw her off, nor can you claime an interest, when you have neglected her in all her miseries; not in your flight, your articles, no, not in your thoughts providing for her. And, had she not fallen into the hands of enemies that were servants too, to honour; you had throwne away a Jewell that had a first thought, even among the gods.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, you have underminde my pride, and remov'd me from that advantage ground I stood on, to my owne low height. These your last words comes neere unto me, and makes me with reverence beleeve all that you have spoken; before your virtues onely sturd my hate and envie, this deed first taught me to admire, and cannot doubt there is a want of any noblenesse, when you have shewne such passionate care in preserving a distressed Virgin, whom I durst not thinke of, least I should thinke too, of her dishonour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, keepe in your joy, wee doe not thinke our selves such high deservers, in doing that which barbarous people would have done, they which would have burnt the Temples, would have kneeld to her, and what duties they neglected to

indowments, admired Princesse, and may a curse light, light on those, who shall dare to unthrone a Majesty which the gods themselves have seated; we are come confident in these your virtues, that you will not disdaine when nobly we endeavour it, to have your greife lessened by your enemies, Madam, though unpropper, yet we are willing comfor∣ters, and have as true a sence of what you suffer as those, who in a neerer name doe share their losses with you.</P>

<P>You make us all happy, and shew a virtue above your sex, in being able so much to love, and yet to loose a Father, if still you can resist this passion, and rejoyce with us, with you we will observe your dayes of mourning. We are now going to pay some Funerall duties to our dead predecessor, for your sake so we will ever call him. Spare these teares, and we will weepe them for you, mourne all as if we had lost a generall parent.</P>

<P>Stay my Lord, you have doom'd him as if you had beene witnesse of his follyes, and if there were not hopes, that he might redeeme hereafter what he has so ill spent, he does deserue a greater punishment; I beseech you Sir, let me intreat for him, he is yet young, and if he have leave, may be virtuous, continue as you have begunne, to change the men, and not destroy 'em: he thrust him∣selfe with confidence on your mercy, let it not be said that was a Snare to any, besides you have made this place a Sanctuary to all those who can claime an interest in that ex∣cellent Lady.</P>

<P>Sir, I have found a royall wellcome, such as cannot be betterd but by your owne wishes, which are the onely things above your actions. Yet ere I goe, I have a request to you, but 'tis such as I must not receive, unlesse another will bee content to aske it for me, you are the man, my Lord, and your company I desire, which if I can obtaine, I dare promise to my selfe a vi∣ctorious enterprise.</P>

<P>Sir, you much honor me, and intreat mee to that I am most ambitious of, my will I freely offer, but the greater part is wholly devoted to your service Sir, and none besides ought to dispose of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thus give it with the rest, by this request, My Lord, I perceive youle keepe your word, and suddenly returne, you would not else at once bereft us of your selfe, and so neere a servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pall.</SPEAKER>
<P>How gladly I would thinke my selfe so much con∣cernd, as to aske a leave of you, but I have ever made my selfe a stranger to you or whats worse, a knowne enemy, and can expect onely ill wishes from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eudo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I thinke not so, you have deserv'd better from me, and if I give you not a leave, tis because I am loath to have you goe, twas you confirm'd my life, when I thought it not in the power of Art, or heaven to have done it, and that before I made not these large expressions, twas because they then became me not, if I had owed lesse, I would have said more.</P>

<P>You have given mee a happinesse, which neither envy, malice, nor the worst of fortune can take from me. I stand the onely man above the stroke of Fate, may I hope to see that ioy dwell in your face againe, which I was never yet so blest as to behold?</P>
