<P>thou canst not see that which cannot with reason be imagined; for it the diuine vertues of Loue, had disperst themselues through the powers of the world, so forcibly as to make them take by his influence, the formes and qualities imprest within them, no doubt they could not c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, but fauour more of his Diuinitie.</P>

<PB REF="5"/>
sensuall appetite vpon lust, seeketh now to quench it with bloud, that being without hope to attaine my loue, hee may with cruelty end my life? Or doth <HI>Ceres,</HI> whose nymph I haue beene many yeares, in recompence of my inuiola∣ble saith, reward me with vnspeakable torments? Diuine <HI>Phoebus</HI> that pursued <HI>Daphne</HI> till shee was turned to a Bay tree, ceased then to trouble her. I, the gods are pitti∣full; and <HI>Cineras,</HI> that with furie followed his daughter Mi∣retia, till shee was chaunged to a Mirretree, left then to prosecute her; yea parents are naturall: <HI>Phoebus</HI> lamen∣ted the losse of his friend, <HI>Cineras</HI> of his child: but both gods, and men either forget or neglect the chaunge of <HI>Fi∣delia</HI>; nay follow her after her chaunge, to make her more miserable: so that there is nothing more hatefull then to be chast, whole bodies are followed in the world with lust, and prosecuted in the graues with tyrannie. Whose minds the freer they are from vice, their bodies are in the more daunger of mischiefe; so that they are not safe when they liue, because of mens loue; nor being chaunged, because of their hates; nor being dead, because of their defaming. What is that chastitie which so few women study to keep, and both gods and men seeke to violate? If onely a na∣ked name, why are we so supersticious of a hollow found? If a rare vertue, why are men so carelesse of such an ex∣ceeding rarenesse: Goe, Ladies, tell <HI>Ceres</HI> I am that <HI>Fide∣lia,</HI> that so long knit Garlands in her honour, and chased with a Satyre, by praier to the gods became turned to a tree, whole body now is growne ouer with rough barke, and whose golden lockes are couered with greene leaues; yet where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd nothing can alter, neither the feare of death, nor the torments. If <HI>Ceres</HI> seeke no reuenge, then let virginitie be not only the scorne of Sauage people, but the spoyle. But alas, I feele my last bloud to come, &amp; ther∣fore must end my last breath. Farewel Ladies, whose liues are subiect to many mischieues; for if you be faire, it is hard to be chast; if chast, impossible to be safe; if you be young,
<PB REF="5"/>
you will quickly bend; if bend, you are suddenly broken. If you be soule, you shall seldome be flattered: if you be not flattered, you will euer bee sorrowfull. Beautie is a firme sicklenes, youth a feeble staiednesse, deformitie a continu∣all sadnesse.</P>
