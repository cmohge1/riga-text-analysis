<P>How I preethee <HI>Will?</HI></P>

<P>Why Sir he serued the great Ladie Kingcob, and was yeoman of her wardroppe, &amp; because a cood brush vp her silkes lustely, she thought hee would curry the e∣nemies coates as soundly, and so by her commendati∣ons, he was made Captaine in the lowe Countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then being made Captaine onely by his Ladies comme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dations, without any worth also of his owne, he was euer after surnamde Captaine Commendations?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bul.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Northern man, or a VVesternmā I take him, but my Captaine is the Emphaticall man; and by that pretty word Emphaticall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ou shall partly know him; for tis a very forcible word in troth, &amp; yet he forces it too much by his fauour; mary no more then he does all the rest of his wordes; with whose multiplicitie often times he trauailes himsele out of all good company.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Gyles Goosecap</HI> has alwayes a deathes head (as it were) in his mouth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>or his onely one reason for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uery thing is, because wee are all mortall; and therefore hee is generally cald the mortall knight; then hath he ano∣ther prettie phrase too, and that is▪ he will tickle the va∣nitie ant still in euery thing and this is your <HI>Summa tota∣lis</HI> of both their virtues.</P>

<P>Thus Sir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>he was betroathed to a gallant young gentleman that loude hir with such passion and admi∣ration that he neuer thought he could bee so blessed as to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>oy her in sull marriage, till the minister was mar∣rying them, and euen then when he was saying I <HI>Charles</HI> take thee <HI>Hippolita;</HI> with extreame ioy he began to looke pale, then going forwardes saying to my wedded wife, he lookt paler, and, then pronouncing, for richer for poorer as long as we both shall liue, he lookt extreame pale; Now sir when she comes to speake her parte, and said, I <HI>Hippolota</HI> take thee <HI>Charles,</HI> hee began to faint for ioy, then saying to my wedded husband, hee began to sinke, but then going forth too for better sor wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e, he
<PB REF="5"/>
coulde stand no longer but with verie conceit it seemd, that shee whome hee tendred as the best of all thinges, shoulde pronounce the worst, and for his sake too, hee suncke downe right, and died sodenly: And thus being halfe married, &amp; her halfe husband wholy dead, I hope I may with discretion affirme her, halfe a maide, halfe a wife, and halfe a widdowe; do ye conceiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> me Sir?</P>

<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then Doctor, since you cannot make any reasonable Connexion of these two contrarieties the minde and the bodie, making both subiect to passion, wherein you confound the substances of both, I must tell you there is no disease of the mind but one, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hat is <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>

<P>VVhy what is loue? is not that a disease of the mind?</P>

<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing so for it springs naturally out of the bloode, nor are wee subiect to any disease, or sorrowe, whose causes or effects simply and natiuely concerne the bodie, that the mind by any meanes partaketh, nor are there any passions in the Soule, for where there are no affections, there are no passions: And <HI>Affectus</HI> your master <HI>Gallen</HI> refers <HI>part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>irascents,</HI> For <HI>illic est anima senti∣ens vbi sunt affectus:</HI> Therefore the Rationall Soule can∣not be there also.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>VVe vse to say so indeed, and from that vse comes the abuse of all knowledge, and her practize, for when the obiect in question onely concerns the state of the bodie? why shood the soule bee sorry or glad for it? if she willingly mixe her selfe, then shee is a foole, if of necessitie and against her will, A slaue, And so, far from that wisdome, and freedome that the Empresse of Reason, and an eternall Substance shood comprehend.</P>
