<HEAD>The Prologue.</HEAD>
<L>THe Roman <HI>and</HI> Athenian Drammaes <HI>farre</HI></L>
<L>Differ from us, And those that frequent are</L>
<L>In <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> even in these dayes,</L>
<L>Compar'd with ours, are rather jiggs than Playes:</L>
<L>Like of the <HI>Spanish</HI> may be said, and <HI>Dutch,</HI></L>
<L>None verst in language, but confesse them such.</L>
<L>They doe not build their projects on that ground,</L>
<L>Nor have their phrases halfe the weight and sound</L>
<L>Our laboured Scenes have had; (and yet our Nation,</L>
<L>Already too much taxt for imitation,</L>
<L>In seeking to Ape others) cannot quit</L>
<L>Some of our Poets, who have sinn'd in it.</L>
<L>For where before great Patriots, Dukes and Kings</L>
<L>Presented for some hie facinorious things,</L>
<L>Were the Stage-Subiect; now we strive to flie</L>
<L>In their low pitch, who never could soare hie:</L>
<L>For now the common argument intreats,</L>
<L>Of puling Lovers, craftie Bawdes or cheates.</L>
<L>Nor blame I their quick fancies, who can fit</L>
<L>These queasie Times, with Humours flash't in wit,</L>
<L>Whose Art I both incourage and commend;</L>
<L>I only wish that they would sometimes bend</L>
<L>To memorise the valour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of such men,</L>
<L>Whose svery names might dignifie the Pen,</L>
<L>And that our (once applauded) Roscian straine,</L>
<L>In acting such might be reviv'd againe:</L>
<L>Which you to countenance, would the Stage make proud,</L>

<P>Come, be not passionate, though I know both my worth

<P>For giving of 'em? Knight there's small honour in ta∣king

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I thinke of it as I ever did, that's as of a bottle of hay,

which I feare you wil never live to hit ful in the eie: <HI>Spayne!</HI> there

<P>Worse then the tother: the Women there are for the

the Country is too hot, too hot.</P>

<SP>

<P>What of the <HI>Russian</HI> then?</P>

<SP>

<P>As of a Country too cold, and in cold countries I know
we should have but cold comfort, besides the women goe wrapt
in so much fur, that of necessity they must have more ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re then
wit, besides they cannot be wise they have so much adoo to keep

come home, and present them with a rush?</P>

<P>The cleane contrary way, oh, my Lord, there are so

<P>In <HI>Flushing,</HI> there is good riding, but not without dan∣ger.
For many at a high tide, have been like to have beene cast
away in the road. At <HI>Middleborough,</HI> night or day you could
scarce finde the Exchange empty. At <HI>Bristles,</HI> if you remember

<L>I thinke none to be made. First for her birth,</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>I have inquir'd her noble: For her breeding,</L>
<L>It hath been 'mongst her equalls, and so farre</L>
<L>From least taxation, to the sayle of tongues,</L>
<L>It merits imitation; of her chastity</L>
<L>Some proofes I have made, and found it like the Diamond,</L>
<L>Save by a Diamond never to be wrought.</L>
<L>Could opportunity have mov'd, words tempted,</L>
<L>Perswasions tooke effect, or guifts prevail'd,</L>
<L>Beneath my much importance she had falne:</L>
<L>But like a promontory rocke shee stands,</L>
<L>At all the curled Oceans wrath unmov'd,</L>
<L>Telling the gusts, and bearing every storme,</L>
<L>Yet on such vertues are her bases fixt,</L>
<L>Shee is not to be shaken, then in her</L>
<L>My travells take their period.</L>

might come to a full poynt: and here shee comes, now or ne∣ver
