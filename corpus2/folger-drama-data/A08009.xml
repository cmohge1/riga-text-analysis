<STAGE>Enter Will Summers in his fooles coate but halfe on, comming out.</STAGE>
</SP>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Octem peccatis, &amp; fraudibus obiice nubem.</HI> There is no such fine time to play the knaue in, as the night. I am a Goose or a Ghost at least; for what with turmoyle of getting my fooles apparell, and care of being perfit, I am sure I haue not yet supt to night. <HI>Will Sum∣mers</HI> Ghost I should be, come to present you with <HI>Summers</HI> last will, and Testament. Be it so, if my cousin <HI>Ned</HI> will lend me his Chayne and his Fiddle. Other stately pac't <HI>Prologues</HI> vse to attire themselues within: I that haue a toy in my head, more then ordinary, and vse to goe without money, without garters, without girdle, without a hat-band, without poynts to my hose, without a knife to my dinner, and make so much vse of this word <HI>without,</HI> in euery thing, will here dresse me with∣out. <HI>Dick Huntley</HI> cryes, Begin, begin: and all the whole house, For shame come away; when I had my things but now brought me out of the <HI>Lawndry.</HI> God forgiue me, I did not see my Lord before. Ile set a good face on it, as though what I had talkt idly all this while, were my part. So it is, <HI>boni viri,</HI> that one foole presents another; and I a foole by nature, and by arte, do speake to you in the person of the Idiot our Play∣maker. He like a Foppe &amp; an Asse, must be making himselfe a publike laughing stock, &amp; haue no thanke for his labor; where other <HI>Magisterij,</HI> whose inuention is farre more exquisite, are content to sit still, and doe nothing. Ile shewe you what a
<PB REF="3"/>
scuruy <HI>Prologue</HI> he had made me in an old vayne of similitudes: if you bee good fellowes, giue it the hearing, that you may iudge of him thereafter.</P>
<P>The Prologue.</P>
<P>AT a solemne feast of the <HI>Triumuiri</HI> in Rome, it was seene and obserued, that the birds ceased to sing, &amp; sate solita∣rie on the house tops, by reason of the sight of a paynted Serpēt set openly to view. So fares it with vs nouices, that here betray our imperfections: we, afraid to looke on the imaginary serpent of Enuy, paynted in mens affections, haue ceased to tune any musike of mirth to your eares this tweluemonth, thinking, that as it is the nature of the serpent to hisse: so childhood and ig∣norance would play the goslings, contemning, and condem∣ning what they vnderstood not. Their censures we wey not, whose sences are not yet vnswadled. The little minutes will be continually striking, though no man regard them. Whelpes will barke, before they can see, and striue to byte, before they haue teeth. <HI>Politianus</HI> speaketh of a beast, who, while hee is cut on the table, drinketh, and represents the motions &amp; voy∣ces of a liuing creature. Such like foolish beasts are we, who, whilest we are cut, mocked, &amp; flowted at, in euery mans com∣mon talke, will notwithstanding proceed to shame our selues, to make sport. No man pleaseth all, we seeke to please one. <HI>Didymus</HI> wrote foure thousand bookes, or as some say, six thou∣sand, of the arte of <HI>Grammar.</HI> Our Authour hopes, it may be as lawfull for him to write a thousand lines of as light a sub∣iect. <HI>Socrates</HI> (whom the Oracle pronounced the wisest man of Greece) sometimes daunced. <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius</HI> by the sea∣side played at peeble-stone. <HI>Semel insaniuimus omnes.</HI> Euery man cannot, with <HI>Archimedes,</HI> make a heauen of brasse, or dig gold out of the iron mynes of the lawe. Such odde trifles, as Mathematicians experiments be, Artificiall flyes to hang in the ayre by themselues, daunsing balles, an egge-shell that shall clyme vp to the top of a speare, fiery breathing goares, <HI>Poetae noster</HI> professeth not to make. <HI>Placeat sibi quis{que} heebit.</HI> What's a foole but his bable? Deepe reaching wits, heere is no deepe

streame for you to angle in. Moralizers, you that wrest a ne∣uer meant meaning, out of euery thing, applying all things to the present time, keepe your attention for the common Stage: for here are no quips in Characters for you to reade. Vayne glozers, gather what you will. Spite, spell backwards, what thou canst. As the <HI>Parthians</HI> fight, flying away: so will wee prate and talke, but stand to nothing that we say.</P>
<P>How say you, my masters, doe you not laugh at him for a Coxcombe? Why, he hath made a <HI>Prologue</HI> longer then his Play: nay, 'tis no Play neyther, but a shewe. Ile be sworne, the sigge of Rowlands God-sonne, is a Gyant in comparison of it. What can be made of Summers last will &amp; Testament? Such another thing, as <HI>Cyllian</HI> of <HI>Braynfords</HI> will, where shee bequeathed a score of farts amongst her friends. Forsooth, be∣cause the plague raignes in most places in this latter end of sum∣mer, Summer must come in sicke: he must call his officers to account, yeeld his throne to Autumne, make Winter his Exe∣cutour, with tittle tattle Tom boy: God giue you good night in Watling street. I care not what I say now: for I play no more then you heare; &amp; some of that you heard to (by your leaue) was extempore. He were as good haue let me had the best part: for Ile be reueng'd on him to the vttermost, in this person of <HI>Will Summer,</HI> which I haue put on to play the <HI>Prologue,</HI> and meane not to put off, till the play be done. Ile sit as a <HI>Chorus,</HI> and flowte the <HI>Actors</HI> and him at the end of euery Sceane: I know they will not interrupt me, for feare of marring of all: but looke to your cues, my masters; for I intend to play the knaue in cue, and put you besides all your parts, if you take not the better heede. <HI>Actors,</HI> you Rogues, come away, cleare your throats, blowe your noses, and wype your mouthes e're you enter, that you may take no occasion to spit or to cough, when you are <HI>non plus.</HI> And this I barre ouer and besides, That none of you stroake your beardes, to make action, play with your cod-piece poynts, or stād fumbling on your buttom, when you know not how to bestow your fingers. Serue God, and act cleanly; a fit of mirth, and an old song first, if you will.</P>

<L>What pleasure alway lasts: no ioy endures:</L>
<L>Summer I was, I am not as I was:</L>

<L>For her doth Summer liue, and linger here,</L>
<L>And wisheth long to liue to her content:</L>
<L>But wishes are not had when they wish well.</L>
<L>I must depart, my death-day is set downe:</L>
<L>To these two must I leaue my wheaten crowne.</L>
<L>So vnto vnthrifts rich men leaue their lands,</L>
<L>Who in an houre consume long labours gaynes.</L>
<L>True is it that diuinest Sidney sung,</L>
<L><HI>O, he is mard, that is for others made.</HI></L>
<L>Come neere, my friends, for I am neere my end.</L>
<L>In presence of this Honourable trayne,</L>
<L>Who loue me (for I patronize their sports)</L>
<L>Meane I to make my finall Testament:</L>
<L>But first Ile call my officers to count,</L>
<L>And of the wealth I gaue them to dispose,</L>
<L>Know what is left. I may know what to giue</L>
<L>Vertumnus then, that turnst the yere about.</L>
<L>Summon them one by one to answere me,</L>
<L>First <HI>Ver,</HI> the spring, vnto whose custody</L>

<P>Troth, my Lord, to tell you playne, I can giue you no other account: <HI>nam quae habui, pordidi;</HI> what I had, I haue spent on good fellowes, in these sports you haue seene, which are proper to the Spring, and others of like sort, (as giuing wenches greene gownes, making garlands for Fencers, and tricking vp children gay) haue I bestowde all my flowry trea∣sure, and flowre of my youth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will Summer.</SPEAKER>
<P>A small matter. I knowe one spent in lesse then a yere, eyght and fifty pounds in mustard, and an other that ranne in det, in the space of foure or siue yeere, aboue foureteene thousand pound in lute strings and gray paper.</P>

<L>O monstrous vnthrift, who e're heard the like?</L>
<L>The seas vast throate in so short tract of time,</L>

Deuoureth nor consumeth halfe so much.</L>
<L>How well mightst thou haue liu'd within thy bounds?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ver.</SPEAKER>
<P>What talke you to me, of liuing within my bounds? I tell you, none but Asses liue within their bounds: the silly beasts, if they be put in a pasture, that is eaten bare to the very earth, &amp; where there is nothing to be had but thistles, will ra∣ther fall soberly to those thistles, and be hungerstaru'd, then they will offer to breake their bounds; whereas the lusty cour∣ser, if he be in a barrayne plot, and spye better grasse in some pasture neere adioyning, breakes ouer hedge and ditch, and to goe, e're he will be pent in, and not haue his belly full. Per∣aduenture, the horses lately sworne to be stolne, carried that youthfull mind, who, if they had bene Asses, would haue bene yet extant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will Summers.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus we may see, the longer we liue, the more wee shall learne: I ne're thought honestie an asse, till this day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ver.</SPEAKER>
<P>This world is transitory, it was made of nothing, and it must to nothing: wherefore, if wee will doe the will of our high Creatour, (whose will it is, that it passe to nothing) wee must helpe to consume it to nothing. Gold is more vile then men: Men dye in thousands, and ten thousands, yea, many times in hundreth thousands in one battaile. If then, the best husband bee so liberall of his best handyworke, to what ende should we make much of a glittering excrement, or doubt to spend at a banket as many pounds, as he spends men at a bat∣taile? Me thinkes I honour <HI>Geta</HI> the Romane Emperour, for a braue minded fellow: for he commaunded a banket to bee made him of all meats vnder the Sunne; which were serued in after the order of the Alphabet; and the Clarke of the kitchin following the last dish (which was two mile off from the for∣most) brought him an Index of their seuerall names: Neyther did he pingle when it was set on the boord, but for the space of three dayes and three nights, neuer rose from the Table.</P>

Summer.</SPEAKER>
<L>Vngratious man, how fondly he argueth!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, I pray, wherefore was gold layd vnder our feete in the veynes of the earth, but that wee should contemne it, and treade vpon it, and so consequently treade thrift vnder our feete? It was not knowne, till the Iron age, <HI>donec facinus inuasit mortales,</HI> as the Poet sayes; and the Scythians alwayes detested it. I will proue it, that an vnthrift, of any, comes nee∣rest a happy man, in so much as he comes neerest to beggery. Cicero saith, <HI>summum bonum</HI> consistes in <HI>omnium rerum vaca∣tione,</HI> that it is the chiefest felicitie that may be, to rest from all labours. Now, who doeth so much <HI>vacare à rebus,</HI> who rests so much? who hath so little to doe, as the begger? Who can sing so merry a note, as he that cannot change a groate? <HI>Cui nil est, nil deest:</HI> hee that hath nothing, wants nothing. On the other side, it is said of the Carle, <HI>Omnia habeo, nec quicquam habeo:</HI> I haue all things, yet want euery thing. <HI>Multi mihi vi∣tio vertunt, quia egeo,</HI> saith Marcus Cato in Aulus Gellius, <HI>at ego illis, quia nequeunt egere:</HI> Many vpbrayde me, sayth he, be∣cause I am poore: but I vpbrayd them, because they cannot liue if they were poore. It is a common prouerbe, <HI>Dines{que} miser{que},</HI> a rich man, and a miserable: <HI>nam natura paucis cōtenta,</HI> none so contented as the poore man. Admit that the chiefest happines were not rest or ease, but knowledge, as Herillus, Al∣cidamas, &amp; many of Socrates followers affirme; why, <HI>paupertas omnes perdocot artes,</HI> pouerty instructs a man in all arts, it makes a man hardy and venturous; and therefore it is called of the Poets, <HI>Paupertas audax,</HI> valiant pouerty. It is not so much subiect to inordinate desires, as wealth or prosperity. <HI>Non habet vnde suum paupertas pascat amorem:</HI> pouerty hath not wherewithall to feede lust. All the Poets were beggers: all Alcumists, and all Philosophers are beggers: <HI>Omnia mea me∣cum porto,</HI> quoth Bias, when he had nothing, but bread and cheese in a letherne bagge, and two or three bookes in his bo∣some. Saint Frauncis, a holy Saint, &amp; neuer had any money. It is madnes to dote vpon mucke. That young man of Athens, (Aelianus makes mention of) may be an example to vs, who
<PB REF="7"/>
doted so extremely on the image of Fortune, that when hee might not inioy it, he dyed for sorrow. The earth yelds all her fruites together, and why should not we spend them together? I thanke heauens on my knees, that haue made mee an vn∣thrift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Summer.</SPEAKER>
<L>O vanitie it selfe; O wit ill spent!</L>
<L>So studie thousands not to mend their liues,</L>
<L>But to maintayne the sinne they most affect,</L>
<L>To be hels aduocates against their owne soules.</L>
<L><HI>Ver,</HI> since thou giu'st such prayse to beggery,</L>
<L>And hast defended it so valiantly,</L>
<L>This be thy penance; Thou shalt ne're appeare,</L>
<L>Or come abroad, but Lent shall wayte on thee:</L>
<L>His scarsity may counteruayle thy waste.</L>
<L>Ryot may flourish, but findes want at last.</L>
<L>Take him away, that knoweth no good way,</L>
<L>And leade him the next way to woe and want.</L>
<STAGE>Exit Ver.</STAGE>
<L>Thus in the paths of knowledge many stray,</L>
<L>And from the meanes of life fetch their decay.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will Summer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigh ho. Here is a coyle in deede to bring beggers to stockes. I promise you truely, I was almost asleep; I thought I had bene at a Sermon. Well, for this one nights exhortation, I vow (by Gods grace) neuer to be good husband while I liue. But what is this to the purpose? <HI>Hur come to Powl</HI> (as the Welshman sayes) <HI>and hur pay an halfepenny for bur seat, and hur heare the Preacher talge, and a talge very well by gis, but yet a cannot make hur laugh: goe a Theater, and heare a Queenes Fice, and he make hur laugh, and laugh hur belly-full.</HI> So we come hither to laugh and be merry, and we heare a filthy beggerly Oration, in the prayse of beggery. It is a beggerly Poet that writ it: and that makes him so much commend it, because hee knowes not how to mend himselfe. Well, rather then he shall haue no imployment but licke dishes, I will set him a worke my selfe, to write in prayse of the arte of stouping, and howe there was neuer any famous Thresher, Porter, Brewer, Pio∣ner, or Carpenter, that had streight backe.

long sicke of a payne in his eyes, whom, vnder pretence of cu∣ring his maladie, he shau'd from one side of his head, to the other, and with a soft pensill wrote vpon his scalpe, (as on parchment) the discourse of his busines, the fellow all the while imagining, his master had done nothing but noynt his head with a feather. After this, hee kept him secretly in his tent, till his hayre was somewhat growne, and then wil'd him to go to <HI>Aristagoras</HI> into the countrey, and bid him shaue him, as he had done, and he should haue perfit remedie. He did so: <HI>Aristagoras</HI> shau'd him with his owne hands, read his friends letter; and when hee had done, washt it out, that no man should perceyue it else, and sent him home to buy him a night∣cap. If I wist there were any such knauery, or Peter Bales <HI>Brachigraphy,</HI> vnder <HI>Sols</HI> bushy hayre, I would haue a Barber, my hoste of the Murrions head, to be his Interpretour, who would whet his rasor on his Richmond cap, and giue him the terrible cut, like himselfe, but he would come as neere as a quart pot, to the construction of it.

That dogs of all come neerest, thus I proue:</L>

<L>Which no one of experience will deny,</L>
<L>They heare, they smell, they see better then we,</L>
<L>To come to speech they haue it questionlesse,</L>
<L>Although we vnderstand them not so well:</L>
<L>They barke as good old Saxon as may be,</L>
<L>And that in more varietie then we:</L>
<L>For they haue one voice when they are in chase,</L>
<L>Another, when they wrangle for their meate,</L>
<L>Another, when we beate them out of dores.</L>
<L>That they haue reason, this I will alleadge,</L>
<L>They choose those things that are most fit for them,</L>
<L>And shunne the contrarie all that they may,</L>
<L>They know what is for their owne diet best,</L>
<L>And seeke about for't very carefully.</L>
<L>At sight of any whip they runne away,</L>
<L>As runs a thiefe from noise of hue and crie:</L>
<L>Nor liue they on the sweat of others browes,</L>
<L>But haue their trades to get their liuing with,</L>
<L>Hunting and conie-catching, two fine artes:</L>
<L>Yea, there be of them as there be of men,</L>
<L>Of euerie occupation more or lesse:</L>
<L>Some cariers, and they fetch, some watermen,</L>
<L>And they will diue and swimme when you bid them:</L>
<L>Some butchers, and they worrie sheep by night:</L>
<L>Some cookes, and they do nothing but turne spits.</L>
<L><HI>Chrisippus</HI> holds, dogs are Logicians,</L>
<L>In that by studie and by canuasing,</L>
<L>They can distinguish twixt three seuerall things,</L>

<L>By which he gesseth that the game went not,</L>
<L>Without more pause he runneth on the third,</L>
<L>Which, as <HI>Chrisippus</HI> saith, infinuates,</L>
<L>As if he reason'd thus within himselfe:</L>
<L><PB REF="12"/>
Eyther he went this, that, or yonder way,</L>
<L>But neyther that, nor yonder, therefore this:</L>
<L>But whether they Logicians be or no,</L>
<L>Cinicks they are, for they will snarle and bite,</L>
<L>Right courtiers to flatter and to fawne,</L>
<L>Valiant to set vpon the enemies,</L>
<L>Most faithfull and most constant to their friends;</L>
<L>Nay they are wise, as <HI>Homer</HI> witnesseth,</L>
<L>Who talking of <HI>Vlisses</HI> comming home,</L>
<L>Saith all his houshold, but <HI>Argus</HI> his Dogge,</L>

<L>Nor <HI>Pallas</HI> Art in altering of his shape,</L>
<L>Nor his base weeds, nor absence twenty yeares,</L>
<L>Could go beyond, or any way delude.</L>
<L>That Dogges Phisicians are, thus I inferre,</L>
<L>They are ne're sicke, but they know their disease,</L>
<L>And finde out meanes to ease them of their griefe,</L>
<L>Speciall good Surgions to cure dangerous wounds:</L>
<L>For strucken with a stake into the flesh,</L>
<L>This policie they vse to get it out:</L>
<L>They traile one of their feet vpon the ground,</L>
<L>And gnaw the flesh about where the wound is,</L>
<L>Till it be cleane drawne out: and then, because</L>
<L>Vlcers and sores kept fowle, are hardly cur'de,</L>
<L>They licke and purifie it with their tongue,</L>
<L>And well obserue Hipocrates old rule,</L>
<L><HI>The onely medicine for the foote, is rest:</HI></L>
<L>For if they haue the least hurt in their feet,</L>
<L>They beare them vp, and looke they be not stird:</L>
<L>When humours rise, they eate a soueraigne herbe,</L>
<L>Whereby what cloyes their stomacks, they cast vp,</L>

<P>Faith, this Sceane of <HI>Orion,</HI> is right <HI>prandium caninum,</HI> a dogs dinner, which as it is without wine, so here's a coyle about dogges, without wit. If I had thought the ship of fooles would haue stay de to take in fresh water at the Ile of dogges, I would haue furnisht it with a whole kennell of col∣lections to the purpose. I haue had a dogge my selfe, that would dreame, and talke in his sleepe, turne round like Ned foole, and sleepe all night in a porridge pot. Marke but the skirmish betweene sixpence and the foxe, and it is miracu∣lous, how they ouercome one another in honorable curtesy. The foxe, though he weares a chayne, runnes as though hee were free, mocking vs (as it is a crafty beast) because we ha∣uing a Lord and master to attend on, runne about at our plea∣sures, like masterles men. Young sixpence, the best page his master hath, playes a little, and retires. I warrant, he will not be farre out of the way, when his master goes to dinner. Learne of him, you deminitiue vrchins, howe to behaue your selues in your vocation, take not vp your standings in a nut∣tree, when you should be waiting on my Lords trencher.
