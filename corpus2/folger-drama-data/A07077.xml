<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Haue euer more endeuoured to know my selfe, than to be knowne of others: and rather to be vnpartially beloued of all, than factiously to bee admired of a few: yet so powerfully haue I been enticed with the delights of Poetry, and (I must ingeniously confesse) aboue better de∣sert so fortunate in these stage-pleasings, that (let my resolutions be neuer so fixed to call mine eyes into my selfe,) I much feare that most lamentable death of him,
<Q><L>Qui nimis notus omnibus,</L>
<L>Ignotus moritur sibi.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>But since the ouer-vehement pursute of these delights hath bin the sicknesse of my youth, and now is growne to be the vice of my firmer age, since to satisfie others, I neglect my selfe, let it be the curtesie of my peruser, rather to pitie my selfe-hindring labours, than to malice me, and let him be pleased to be my reader, and not my interpreter, since I would faine reserue that office in my owne hands, it being my dayly prayer, <HI>Absit à iocorum nostrorum simplicitate malignus interpres.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI></NOTE></P>
<P>If any shall wonder why I print a Comedie, whose life rests much in the Actors voice Let such know, that it cannot auoide publish∣ing: let it therefore stand with good excuse, that I haue been my owne setter out.</P>
<P>If any desire to vnderstand the scope of my Comedie, know it hath the same limits, which <HI>Iuuenal</HI> giues to his Satyres,

<P>As for the factious malice, and studied detractions of some few that tread in the same path with me, let all know, I most easi∣ly neglect them, and (carelesly slumbring to their vitious ende∣uours) smile hartily at their selfe-hurting basenesse. My bosome friend good <HI>Epictetus</HI> makes me easily to contemne all such mens malice: since other mens tongues are not within my teeth, why <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

let this be printed, that of men of my owne addiction, I loue most, pitie some, hate none: For let mee truely say it, I once only loued my selfe, for louing them, and surely, I shall euer rest so constant to my first affection, that let their vngentle combinings, discur∣teous whisperings, neuer so treacherously labour to vndermine my vnfenced reputation, I shall (as long as I haue being) loue the least of their graces, and only pitie the greatest of their vices.</P>
<P>And now to kill enuie, know you that affect to be the onely Minion of <HI>Phebus,</HI> I am not so blushlesly ambitious as to hope to gaine any the least supreame eminencie amonge you, <HI>I</HI> affect not onely <HI>the Euge tuum, &amp; Bellè!</HI> tis not my fashion to thinke no writer vertuously confident, that is not swellingly impudent.
