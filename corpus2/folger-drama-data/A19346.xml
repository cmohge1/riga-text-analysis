For how could I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope any thing from mine owne sufficiencie, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing little exercised in the French tongue, and

So that what w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with much labour compasse, is your daily exer∣cise. For if that which <HI>Augustus</HI> attributed to <HI>Vinicius,</HI> that he had <HI>Solus ingenium in numerato,</HI> can snit with any man, it does with your Lordship, whose wit we have so often seene ready told out, and fit for any emanation: and with which you have justly purchased every mans wonder and astonishment. It was there∣fore aptly and truly said by a noble man of your owne ranke and order, that when you spoke in any businesse you imposed oblivion on what was said before you, and silence on any man that should speake after you. It behooves me then (since I must feare your judgement) to flie to that sweetnesse of your disposition (the temper of your vertues) with which you use to receive the offers that come from a gratefull heart. Un lesse I should presume to thinke that your Lord ship cannot without delight survey the person of D. <HI>Roderigo</HI> in this play, with whom you life has held some proportion, for like him yo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have ever preferr'd your honour to your affe¦ctions, and your King and Countrey to an thing besides: which you did not so much, be∣cause

The Play it selfe, being a true history, though like a Romance (since this age consists of such Play-seers) I would willingly propose to be imitated of our undertakers in the like kinde, I meane for the conveyance, and (as I may call it) the Oeconomy of it: for what concernes the wit and naturall expressions in it; I know I speak to deafe people, whose

<L>Who has made you so weake? or him so valiant?</L>
<L><HI>Roderigo</HI> goes to fight, and thinkes himselfe</L>
<L>Already dead. He that nor fear'd the Moores,</L>
<L><PB REF="34"/>
Nor yet my Father, going to encounter</L>
<L>Don <HI>Sancho,</HI> trembles at it. Does your spirit</L>
<L>Fayle you at greatest need?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis not to the Combat</L>
<L>That I goe now, but to my punishment.</L>
<L>For when you seeke my death, my love cannot</L>
<L>Defend a life against you. My heart is still</L>
<L>The same, but not my arme, when it should guard</L>
<L>That which displeases you. This night already</L>
<L>Had beene my last, if for my private quarrell</L>
<L>The fight had beene: But since 'twas for the King,</L>
<L>His People, and my Countrye, had I left</L>
<L>My selfe defencelesse, I'de betray'd them all:</L>
<L>I must confesse, I did not hate my life</L>
<L>So much as with false treachery to part from't.</L>
<L>Now, since no interest but mine owne is in it,</L>
<L>And you demaund my death, I accept your sentence,</L>
<L>For which y'have made choise of another hand.</L>
<L>(It seemes I not deserv'd to dye by yours)</L>
<L>I shall not goe to exchange blow, for blow,</L>
<L>I owe him more respect that fights for you</L>
<L>And since it is your honour which hee fights for,</L>
<L>I'le open him my brest, in his, adoring</L>
<L>Your hand, from which I'le welcome my destruction.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CIMENA.</SPEAKER>
<L>If the just violence of a fatall duty,</L>
<L>Which makes me to pursue thee 'gainst my will,</L>
<L>Prescribe unto thy love so hard a law,</L>
<L>That thou wilt not defend thy selfe 'gainst him</L>
<L>That fights for me. Take head least thou forget</L>
<L>That both thy life, and glory fall together,</L>
<L>And howsoever <HI>Roderigo</HI> has liv'd</L>
<L>Being slaine, he will be thought a vanquisht man.</L>
<L><PB REF="34" MS="y"/>
Honour was dearer once then I was to you,</L>
<L>When in my Fathers bloud you imbru'd your hands,</L>
<L>It made you then in spight of your affection</L>
<L>Renounce the hope of ere injoying me;</L>
<L>But now you value it so little that</L>
<L>You care not who it is that conquers you.</L>
<L>See how unseasonable your vertue is,</L>
<L>Why were you valiant once &amp; are not now?</L>
<L>Were you so onely to doe me an outrage?</L>
<L>Or will you be so cruell to my father,</L>
<L>That having conquer'd him, you will submit</L>
<L>Your selfe to any hand. No <HI>Roderigo</HI></L>
<L>Defend thy honor, though thou slight thy life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mine honor cannot need any defence</L>
<L>More than it has already. He that could</L>
<L>Defeat the Moores, and kill the Count of <HI>Gormas,</HI></L>
<L>Has not an enemy besides to feare.</L>
<L>No, no, <HI>Roderigo</HI> know's what ere you thinke,</L>
<L>How in this fight to die and save his honour,</L>
<L>That none shall dare to thinke he wanted courage,</L>
<L>Onely they'le say he did adore <HI>Cimena.</HI></L>
<L>He would not live, having deserv'd her hate,</L>
<L>How he gave way unto the cruell fate</L>
<L>which forc'd his Mistresse to pursue his death.</L>
<L>Shee ask'd his head, and his great heart conceiv'd</L>
<L>He should commit a crime, if he deny'd it.</L>
<L>T'acquit his honour he renounc'd his love,</L>
<L>T'acquit his Mistresse he renounc'd his life.</L>
<L>Thus shall you see my glory in this Combat</L>
<L>Shine more than ere it did. My willing death</L>

<L>By that your Majesty might easily see,</L>
<L>I meant my love should give place to my duty.</L>
<L>In fine <HI>Roderigoe's</HI> dead. His death has chang'd</L>
<L>Her, who was once his mortall enemy</L>
<L>To an afflicted lover. That revenge</L>
<L>I to my Father ought, and to my love</L>
<L>These teares which now I shed; Don <HI>Sancho</HI> has</L>
<L>In taking of my part quite ruin'd me,</L>
<L>And yet for doing so I'me made his prize.</L>
<L>Sir, if kind pitty ever mov'd a King,</L>
<L>Now of your grace revoke this cruell law,</L>
<L>Though he have slaine the man I lov'd so dearely,</L>
<L>I'le give him all I have for his reward,</L>
<L>So he will leave me to my selfe, and that</L>
<L>I may bewaile (the time I have to live)</L>
<L>My Father, and my Lover, in a Cloister.</L>

Don <HI>Sancho</HI> has made thee a false report.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. SANCHO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, not by me, but by her too much heat</L>
<L>Shee was deceiv'd: For had she given me leave;</L>
<L>I should have told her, that her noble Lover,</L>
<L>When he disarm'd me, bade me banish feare,</L>
<L>For that (sai'd he) I'de rather leave the conquest</L>
<L>Uncertaine, than I'de spill a drop of bloud</L>
<L>That's ventur'd for <HI>Cimena,</HI> but since I</L>
<L>Am by my duty call'd to attend the King,</L>
<L>Ooe you and entertaine her in my stead,</L>
<L>And at her feet offer your life and sword.</L>
<L>Which when I came to doe, the sword deceiv'd her,</L>
<L>With which seeing me returne, she thought that I</L>
<L>Had beene the Victor. Presently her anger</L>
<L>Betray'd her love, with such impatience</L>
<L>That I had not a minutes audience.</L>
<L>For my part though I am a vanquish'd man,</L>
<L>And though the interest of my love be great</L>
<L>Yet I repute my selfe in this my losse</L>
<L>To be a gainer, loving my distresse</L>
<L>Which brings so faire a flame, so good successe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>You must not be asham'd of such a love</L>
<L><HI>Cimena,</HI> or seeke meanes to disavow it,</L>
<L>Your honour's disingag'd, your duty quitted,</L>
<L>Your Father satisfied; what would you more?</L>
<L>Must you still put <HI>Roderigo</HI> in new danger,</L>
<L>You see hea ven otherwise disposes of him.</L>
<L>And since that it has done so much for him,</L>
<L>Doe you too something for your selfe, and take</L>

<L>Great Sir, be not offended if before you,</L>
<L>The duty which I owe to love, doe cast me</L>
<L>Here at her feet. I come not to demand</L>
<L>The prize which I have won, but once more yet</L>
<L>To offer you my life. My love shall not</L>
<L>Or plead the combats law, or the Kings will,</L>
<L>If all that's done cannot appease your anger,</L>
<L>Tell me what meanes is left to satisfie.</L>
<L>Must I encounter yet a thousand Rivals,</L>
<L>Travaile from one end of the Earth to th' other</L>
<L>Or force a Camp my selfe, or rout an Army,</L>
<L>If at length I may expiate my crime,</L>
<L>I shall attempt all this: But if your honour</L>
<L>Be still inexorable, and nothing can</L>
<L><PB REF="40" MS="y"/>
Appease it but my death; Behold my head</L>
<L>I cast it at your feet. Take it your selfe,</L>
<L>And arme no other hand for your revenge,</L>
<L>Since none but yours can do't. Yet let my death</L>
<L>Be all my punishment, and let me not</L>
<L>Be banish'd from your memory, but say</L>
<L>If any time you call to mind my paine</L>
<L>Had he not lov'd me, he had not been slaine,</L>

<SPEAKER>CIMENA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rise <HI>Roderigo.</HI> Sir, I must needs say</L>
<L>My love has shew'd it selfe too much, for me</L>
<L>Now to deny it. <HI>Roderigo</HI> has</L>
<L>Such vertues, as I know not how to hate.</L>
<L>And you're my King. I cannot but obey you,</L>
<L>But is there here any appearance of</L>
<L>A Marriage, if it be, it is a sad one,</L>
<L>That one day should begin, and end my mourning,</L>
<L>That having lay'd my Father in his grave,</L>
<L>I should lay <HI>Roderigo</HI> in my bed:</L>
<L>That were to hold intelligence with's murtherer,</L>
<L>And soyle my honour with eternall shame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Time often makes that lawfull, which at present</L>
<L>Seemes not to be so. <HI>Roderigo,</HI> has won thee,</L>
<L>And his thou must be. But though his valour</L>
<L>Have made you his, yet I should doe you wrong</L>
<L>So soone to give him the reward he fought for.</L>
<L>Take if you will a yeare, to end your mourning.</L>
<L>In the meane time <HI>Roderigo</HI> shall take armes,</L>
<L>And having under his command my Army,</L>
<L>Shall carry back the War unto the Moores</L>
<L>Which they brought hither, that they all may tremble</L>
<L>At this brave name of CID, which they have given thee</L>
<L>They've call'd thee Lord already, and they would</L>
<L>Make thee their King. But let not <HI>(Roderigo)</HI></L>

Thy great exploits, take off thy loyalty;</L>
<L>Returne, if possible, more worthy of her,</L>
