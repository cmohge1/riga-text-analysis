<L>Let vs request your graue aduice, my Lords,</L>
<L>For the disposing of our princely daughters,</L>
<L>For whom our care is specially imployd,</L>
<L>As nature bindeth to aduaunce their states,</L>
<L>In royall marriage with some princely mates:</L>
<L>For wanting now their mothers good aduice,</L>
<L>Vnder whose gouernment they haue receyued</L>
<L>A perfit patterne of a vertuous life:</L>
<L>Left as it were a ship without a sterne,</L>
<L>Or silly sheepe without a Pastors care;</L>
<L>Although our selues doe dearely tender them,</L>
<L>Yet are we ignorant of their affayres:</L>
<L>For fathers best do know to gouerne sonnes;</L>
<L>But daughters steps the mothers counsell turnes.</L>
<L>A sonne we want for to succeed our Crowne,</L>
<L>And course of time hath cancelled the date</L>
<L>Of further issue from our withered loynes</L>
<L>One foote already hangeth in the graue,</L>
<L>And age hath made deepe furrowes in my face:</L>
<L>The world of me, I of the world am weary,</L>
<L>And I would fayne resigne these earthly cares,</L>
<L>And thinke vpon the welfare of my soule:</L>
<L>Which by no better meanes may be effected,</L>

<L>When fates should loose the prison of your life,</L>
<L>By whose succession all this doubt might cease;</L>

<L>But after-wishes euer come too late,</L>
<L>And nothing can reuoke the course of fate:</L>
<L>Wherefore, my Liege, my censure deemes it best,</L>
<L>To match them with some of your neighbour Kings,</L>
<L>Bordring within the bounds of Albion,</L>
<L>By whose vnited friendship, this our state</L>
<L>May be protected gainst all forrayne hate.</L>

<L>My youngest daughter, fayre <HI>Cordella,</HI> vowes</L>
<L>No liking to a Monarch, vnlesse loue allowes,</L>

<L>The know this first, I am a Brittayne borne,</L>
<L>and had three daughters by one louing wife:</L>
<PB REF="32"/><FW><MILESTONE N="H3v"/></FW>
<L>And though <HI>I</HI> say it, of beauty they were sped;</L>
<L>Especially the youngest of the three,</L>
<L>For her perfections hardly matcht could be:</L>
<L>On these <HI>I</HI> doted with a ielous loue,</L>
<L>And thought to try which of them lou'd me best,</L>
<L>By asking them, which would do most for me?</L>
<L>The first and second flattred me with words,</L>
<L>And vowd they lou'd me better then their liues:</L>
<L>The youngest sayd, she loued me as a child</L>
<L>Might dō: her answere I esteem'd most vild,</L>
<L>And presently in an outragious mood,</L>
<L>I turnd her from me to go sinke or swym:</L>
<L>And all I had, euen to the very clothes,</L>
<L>I gaue in dowry with the other two:</L>
<L>And she that best deseru'd the greatest share,</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> gaue her nothing, but disgrace and care.</L>
<L>Now mark the sequell: When I had done thus,</L>
<L>I soiourned in my eldest daughters house,</L>
<L>Where for a time <HI>I</HI> was intreated well,</L>
<L>And liu'd in state sufficing my content:</L>
<L>But euery day her kindnesse did grow cold,</L>
<L>Which I with patience put vp well ynough,</L>
<L>And seemed not to see the things I saw:</L>
<L>But at the last she grew so far incenst</L>
<L>With moody fury, and with causlesse hate,</L>
<L>That in most vild and contumelious termes,</L>
<L>She bade me pack, and harbour some where else.</L>
<L>Then was I fayne for refuge to repayre</L>
<L>Vnto my other daughter for reliefe,</L>
<L>Who gaue me pleasing and most courteous words;</L>
<L>But in her actions shewed her selfe so sore,</L>
<L>As neuer any daughter did before:</L>
<L>She prayd me in a morning out betime,</L>
<L>To go to a thicket two miles from the Court,</L>
<L>Poynting that there she would come talke with me:</L>
<L>There she had set a shaghayrd murdring wretch,</L>
<L>To massacre my honest friend and me.</L>
