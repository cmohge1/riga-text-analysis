<L>SInce tis become the Title of our Play,</L>
<L>A woman once in a Coronation may</L>

<L>A welcome to the Theater, as he</L>
<L>That with a little beard, a long blacke clok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>

<L>If you be kind, and noble, you will not</L>
<L>Thinke the worse of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for my petticote.</L>
<L>But to the Play, the Poet bad me tell</L>
<L>His feares first in the title, lest it swell</L>
<L>Some thoughts with expectation of a straine,</L>
<L>That but once could be seene in a Kings raigne,</L>
<L>This Coronation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hopes you may</L>

<L>For which although dull soules his pen dispise,</L>
<L>Who thinkes it yet too earely to be wise.</L>
<L>The nobler will thanke his muse, at least</L>
