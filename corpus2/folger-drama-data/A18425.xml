<L>And though things long since done, were long since known,</L>
<L>And so may seeme superfluous to repeat;</L>

<L>As nature works in all things to an end,</L>
<L>So in th'appropriate honor of that end,</L>
<L>All things precedent haue their naturall frame;</L>
<L>And therefore is there a proportion</L>
<L>Betwixt the ends of those things and their primes:</L>
<L>For else there could not be in their creation,</L>
<L>Alwayes, or for the most part, that firme forme</L>
<L>In their still like existence; that we see</L>
<L>In each full creature. What proportion then</L>
<L>Hath an immortall with a mortall substance?</L>
<L>And therefore the mortality to which</L>
<L>A man is subiect; rather is a sleepe,</L>
<L>Then bestiall death; since sleepe and death are call'd</L>
<L>The twins of nature. For if absolute death</L>
<L>And bestiall sease the body of a man,</L>
<L>Then is there no proportion in his parts,</L>
<L>His soule being free from death, which otherwise</L>
<L><PB REF="29"/>Retaines diuine proportion For as sleepe</L>
<L>No disproportion holds with humane soules,</L>
<L>But aptly quickens the proportion</L>
<L>Twixt them and bodies, making bodies fitter▪</L>
<L>To giue vp formes to soules, which is their end:</L>
<L>So death (twin-borne of sleepe) resoluing all</L>
<L>Mans bodies heauy parts; in lighter nature</L>
