<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Generall scope of this Drammaticall Poem, is to set forth (in Tropicall and shadowed collours) the Greatnes, Magna∣nimity, Constancy, Clemency, and other the incomparable Heroical vertues of our late Queene And (on the contrary part) the inueterate malice, Treasons, Ma∣chinations Vnderminings, &amp; continual blody stratagems, of that Purple whore of Roome, to the taking away of our Princes liues, and vtter extirpation of their Kingdomes. Wherein if accor∣ding to the dignity of the Subiect, I haue not giuen it Lustre, and (to vse the Painters rhethorick) doe so faile in my Depthes &amp; Heightnings, that it is not to the life, let this excuse me; that the <HI>Pyramides</HI> vpon whose top the glorious Raigne of our de∣ceased Soueraigne was mounted, stands yet so high, and so sharp∣ly pointed into the clouds, that the Art of no pen is able to reach it. The streame of her Vertues is so immēsurable, that the farther they are waded into, the farther is it to the bottom.</P>
<P>In sayling vpon which two contrary Seas, you may obserue, on how direct a line I haue steered my course: for of such a scant∣ling are my words set downe, that neither the one party speakes too much, nor the other (in opposition) too little in their owne defence.</P>
<P>And whereas I may, (by some more curions in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nsure, then sound in iudgement) be Critically taxed, that I falsifie the ac∣count of time, and set not down Occurrents, according to their true succession, let such (that are so nice of stomach) know, that I write as a Poet, not as an Historian, and that these two doe not
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
liue vnder one law. How true Fortunes dyall hath gone whose Players (like so many clocks, haue struck my lines, and told the world how I haue spent my houres) I am not certaine, because mine eare stood not within reach of their Larums. But of this my knowledge cannot faile, that in such Consorts, many of the Instruments are for the most partout of tune, And no maruaile; for let the Poet set the note of his Nombers, euen to <HI>Apolloes</HI> owne Lyre, the Player will haue his owne Cro∣chets, and sing false notes, in dispite of all the rules of Musick. It fares with these two, as it does with good stuffe and a badde Tayler: It is not mard in the wearing, but in the cutting out. The labours therfore of Writers are as vnhappie as the children of a bewtifull woman, being spoyld by ill nurses, within a month after they come into the world. What a number of throwes doe we endure eare we be deliuered? and yet euen then (tho that hea∣uenly issue of our braine be neuer so faire and so well lymd,) is it made lame by the bad handling of them to whome it is put to learne to goe: if this of mine bee made a cripple by such meanes, yet dispise him not for that deformity which stuck not vpon him at his birth; but fell vpon him by mis-fortune, and in recompence of such favour, you shall (if your Patience can suffer so long) heare now how himselfe can speake.</P>

<L>(Through those thin vailes we hang betweene your sight,</L>
<L>And this our peice) may reach the mistery:</L>
<L>What in it is most graue, will most delight.</L>
<L>But as in <HI>Lantskip,</HI> Townes and Woods appeare</L>
<L>Small a farre off, yet to the Optick sence,</L>
<L>The mind shewes them as great as those more neere;</L>

<L>Raize vp the dead: vpon this narrow floore</L>
<L>Swell vp an Ocean, (with an Armed Fleete,)</L>
<L>And lay the Dragon at a Doues softfeete.</L>
<L>These Wonders sit and see, sending as guides</L>
<L>Your Iudgement, not your passions: passion slides,</L>
<L>When Iudgement goes vpright: for tho the Muse</L>
<L>(Thats thus inspir'de) a Nouell path does tread,</L>
<L>Shee's free from foolish boldnes, or base dread.</L>

<P>All your fine men liue and die there, it's the Knights ward, and therefore mustneeds bee braue: some call it an Ordi∣narie, but I say tis a prison, for most of our gallants that are ser∣ued euery day with woodcockes there, lie there in a manner vp∣on Execution: they dare not peepe out of doores for feare of Serieants.</P>

<P>Mary then doe all the gyltrapiers turne their Tobacco faces in the roome vpon me, and they puffe, they gape on a fresh man like so many stale Oysters at a full tyde: then is there no salt to throw vpon them, and to make them leaue gaping, but this; to cast off his cloake, hauing good cloathes vnderneath, sin∣gle out some in the roome worse accoustred then himselfe, with him to walke boldly vp and downe strutting, laugh alowd at a∣ny thing, talke alowde of nothing, so they make a noise, it is no matter.</P>

<P>Troth mistresse, I left villains and knaues there, &amp; find knaues &amp; fooles here: for your Ordinary is your Isle of Gulles, your ship of fooles, your hospitall of incurable madmen: it is the field where your captaine and braue man is cal'd to the lastrec∣koning, and is ouerthrown horse and foot: it is the onely schoole to make an honest man a knaue: for Intelligencers may heare e∣nough there, to set twenty a begging oflands: it is the strangest Chesse-board in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Titan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why?</L>
</SP>
