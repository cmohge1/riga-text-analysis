<L>The faults of Kings are by the Thunderer</L>

<L>Make payment of the debt you ow'd her, better</L>
<L>Then in your late reproofes not of her, but</L>
<L>Those crimes that made her worthy of reproofe.</L>
<L>The most remarkeable point in which kings differ</L>
<L>From priuate men, is, that they not alone</L>
<L>Stand bound to be in themselues innocent,</L>
<L>But that all such as are allide to them</L>
<L>In neeren esse, or dependance, by their care</L>
<L>Should be free from suspition of all crime;</L>
<L>And you haue reap'd a double benefit</L>
