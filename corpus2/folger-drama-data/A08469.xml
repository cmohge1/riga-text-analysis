<L>About religion (as I heard) my Lord.</L>
<L>Lord Powesse detracted from the power of Rome,</L>

<L>By the lord Herbert, they were traytors all</L>
<L>That would maintaine it: Powesse answered,</L>
<L>They were as true, as noble, and as wise</L>
<L>As he, that would defend it with their liues,</L>
<L>He namde for instance sir Iohn Old-castle</L>
<L>The Lord Cobham: He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert replide againe,</L>
<L>He, thou, and all are traitors that so hold.</L>

<L>Gentlemen, Iustices, master Maior, and master Shrieue,</L>

<L>For the Kings preparation into France.</L>
<L>We heare of secret conuenticles made,</L>
<L>And there is doubt of some conspiracies,</L>
<L>Which may breake out into rebellious armes</L>
<L>When the King's gone, perchance before he go:</L>
<L>Note as an instance, this one perillous fray,</L>
<L>What factions might haue growne on either part,</L>
<L>To the destruction of the King and Realme,</L>
<L>Yet, in my conscience, sir Iohn Old-castle</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>Innocent of it, onely his name was vsde.</L>

<L>You maister Maior, looke to your citizens,</L>
