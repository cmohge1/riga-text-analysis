I hired me a little shop, fought low, tooke small gaine, kept no debt booke, garnished my shop for want of Plate, with good wholsome thriftie sentences; As, <HI>Touchstone, keepe thy shopp, and thy shoppe will keepe thee.

The Farmer hee is euer at oddes with the Weather, sometimes the clowdes haue beene too barren; Sometimes the Heauens forgette themselues, their Har∣uests answere not their hopes; Sometimes the Season falles out too fruitefull, Corne will beare no price, and so foorth. Th'Artificer, hee's all for a stirring worlde, if his Trade bee too full and fall short of his expectation, then falles he out of ioynt.

<P>Faith to seeke her Fortune I thinke. I said I had a castle and land Eastward, and Eastward she will without contra∣diction; her coach, and the coach of the Sunne must meete full butt: And the Sunne being out shined with her Lady-ships glorie, she feares hee goes Westward to hange him∣selfe.</P>

She would long for euery thing when she was a maide; and now she will runne mad for 'hem: I laye my life she will haue euery yeare foure children; and what charge and change of humour you must endure while she is with childe; and how she will tie you to your tackling till she be with child, a Dog would not endure: Nay, there is no Turne-spit Dog bound to his wheele more seruily, then you shall be to her wheele; For as that Dogge can neuer climbe the top of his wheele, but when the toppe comes vnder him: so shall you neuer clime the top of her contentment, but when she is vnder you.</P>

<P>Out of my fortune, what a death is my life bound face to face too?
