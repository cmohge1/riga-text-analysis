<L>What know you not, that Castles are not wonne</L>
<L>At first assault, and women are not wooed</L>
<L>When first their suters profer loue to them:</L>
<L>As for my part, I should account that maide</L>
<L>A wanton wench, vnconstant lewde and light,</L>
<L>That yeelds the field, before she venture fight.</L>
<L>Especially vnto her mortall foe,</L>
