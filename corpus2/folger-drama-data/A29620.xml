<P>Yet all things go currant; if the Ladies were as nim∣ble in their excuse as we were quick in our passage through the private doore, I hope neither the Duke nor any of his Court can any way trace us in our proceedings; some Lovers would think me a most happy creature to enjoy the love of so beautiful a La∣dy, and for ought I know I may be so; but I have made a Vow never to marry a wife, but first to make some perfect and sound triall of her affection towards me; but because there is no wo∣man that loves a man living, but she will infinitely lament him dead, it shall be thought that I have drown'd my selfe, of which I will give the Court some assured instance, and afterwards li∣ving hereabouts in some odd disguise, I shall truly understand how she takes my death; if in any extremity of griefe, I will revive her with as great a surplusage of joy; but if she take it coldly, as a business that little concernes her, Ile leave her to the mercy of him that bids fairest for her; and to my plot, I stay but for some company that may see me throw my selfe desperately into the River, heare my passion and report it—</P>
