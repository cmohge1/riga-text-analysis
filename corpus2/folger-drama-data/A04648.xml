<L>O, I craue pardon, I had lost my thoughts.</L>
<L>VVhy <HI>Humor</HI> (as 'tis <HI>ens</HI>) we thus define it</L>
<L>To be a qualitie of aire or water,</L>
<L>And in it selfe holds these two properties,</L>
<L>Moisture and Fluxure: As for demonstration,</L>
<L>Poure water on this floore, 'twill wet and runne,</L>
<L>Likewise the aire (forc't through a horne or trumpet)</L>
<L>Flowes instantly away, and leaves behind</L>
<L>A kind of dew; and hence we doe conclude,</L>
<L>That what soe're hath fluxure and humiditie,</L>
<L>As wanting power to containe it selfe,</L>
<L>Is <HI>Humor:</HI> so in euery humane bodie</L>
<L>The choller, melancholy, flegme, and bloud,</L>
<L>By reason that they flow continually</L>
<L>In some one part, and are not continent,</L>
<L>Receiue the name of Humors. Now thus farre</L>
<L>It may by Metaphore applie it selfe</L>
<L>Vnto the generall disposition,</L>
<L>As when some one peculiar qualitie</L>
<L>Doth so possesse a man, that it doth draw</L>
<L>All his affects, his spirits, and his powers</L>
<L>In their confluctions all to runne one way,</L>
<L>This may be truly said to be a Humor,</L>
<L>But that a Rooke in wearing a pied feather,</L>
<L>The cable hatband, or the three-pild ruffe,</L>
<L>A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot</L>

at first nothing but a simple and continued Satyre, sung by one
only person, till <HI>Susario</HI> invented a second, after him <HI>Epicharmus</HI>
a third, <HI>Phormus,</HI> and <HI>Chionides</HI> devised to have foure actors, with
a <HI>Prologue</HI> and <HI>Chorus;</HI> to which <HI>Cratinus</HI> (long after) added a fift
and sixt; <HI>Eupolis</HI> more, <HI>Aristophanes</HI> more than they: every
man in the dignitie of his spirit and judgement, supplied some∣thing:
and (though that in him this kind of Poeme appeared
absolute, and fully perfected) yet how is the face of it chang'd
since, in <HI>Menander, Philemon, Cecilius, Plautus,</HI> and the rest; who
have vtterly excluded the <HI>Chorus,</HI> altered the propertie of the
persons, their names, and natures, and augmented it with all
libertie, according to the elegancie and disposition of those
times wherein they wrote? I see not then but we should enjoy
<PB REF="8"/>
the same <HI>Licentia</HI> or free power, to illustrate and heighten our

<L>She waies the things I doe, with what she merits:</L>
<L>And (seeing my worth outwai'd so in her graces)</L>
<L>She is so solemne, so precise, so froward,</L>
<L>That no obseruance I can doe to her,</L>
<L>Can make her kind to me: if she find fault,</L>
<L>I mend that fault, and then she saies I faulted</L>

<L>VVhen women doubt most of their husbands loues,</L>
<L>They are most louing. Husbands must take heed</L>
<L>They giue no gluts of kindnesse to their wiues,</L>

<L>Not with a manger-full of meat together,</L>
<L>But halfe a pecke at once, and keepe them so</L>
<L>Still with an appetite to that they giue them.</L>
<L>He that desires to haue a louing wife,</L>
<L>Must bridle all the shew of that desire:</L>
<L>Be kind, not amorous, nor bewraying kindnesse,</L>
<L>As if Loue wrought it, but considerate Dutie:</L>

<P>VVhy (by that proportion) the Court might as well

Pretext, by how much the place transcends and goes before

make any exception at the opening of such an emptie Trunk

<P>No more, assure you, will any graue wise Cittizen, or

For that were to affirme, that a man writing of <HI>Nero,</HI> should
meane all Emperours: or speaking of <HI>Machiavell,</HI> comprehend
all States-men; or in our <HI>Sordido,</HI> all Farmars; and so of the
rest: than which, nothing can bee vtter'd more malicious
and absurd. Indeed there are a sort of these narrow-ey'd De∣cipherers,
I confesse, that will extort straunge and abstruse
meanings out of any Subject, bee it neuer so Conspicuous
and Innocently deliuerd. But to such (where e're they sit con∣ceald)
let them know, the Authour defies them, and their
writing-Tables; and hopes, no sound or safe judgement
will infect it selfe with their contagious Comments, who

<P>Sweet and deare father, (desiring you first to send mee your blessing, which is more worth to me than Gold or Siluer) I desire you likewise to bee
aduertised, that this Shrouctide (contrarie to custome) wee vse alwaies to

truth; especially if wee Gentlemen bee well attir'd, which our Seniors note,
and thinke the better of our fathers, the better wee are maintain'd, and
that they shall know if they come vp, and haue any thing to doe in the
Law: therefore good Father, these are (for your owne sake as well as mine)
to re-desire you, that you let me not want that which is fit for the setting vp
of our name in the honourable volume of Gentilitie, that I may say to our
Calumnators with <HI>Tullie,</HI> EGO SVM ORTVS DOMVS

<P>Faith, I cannot tell Sister, but if a man had any true

see his sonnes throat cut too, ere he make him a true Gentle∣man
indeed, before Death cut his owne throat▪ I must be the
first Head of our house, and yet he will not giue mee the head,

it. And now (that you may see I will be out of <HI>Humor</HI> for com∣panie)
I stand wholly to your kind <HI>Approbation,</HI> and (indeed)
am nothing so peremptorie as I was in the beginning: Mary
I will not doe as <HI>Plautus</HI> in his <HI>Amphitryo</HI> for all this (<HI>Summi Iouis
causa, Plaudite:</HI>) begge a <HI>Plaudite</HI> for Gods sake; but if you (out
of the Bountie of your good liking) will bestow it; why, you
