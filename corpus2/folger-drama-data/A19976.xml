<P>The Ile of Gulls, what should that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>A play by the name, but come shals quarter our selues?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>If some had had the wit to doe so in time, they might ha saude
the hangman a labour. But come boy, furnish vs with stooles.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Prologue.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me sir, my office is to speake a Prologue, not to pro∣uide
you stooles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>And you were the Epilogue to sir-</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie be not inciuill: dost heare youth, prethe whats he that dis∣couerd
your new found Land, the Ile of Gulls? what is hee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>A meere stranger sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3</SPEAKER>
<P>A stranger? the better welcome: comes hee East-ward,
West-ward, or North-ward hoe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of the three waies I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>Prethe where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not on his knees in a corner, to <HI>Apollo</HI> praying that his play
may hold in a good hand at Passadge, not on the stage amongst gal∣lants,
preparing a bespoke Plaudite; but close in his studie writing
hard, to get him a handsome suite against Sommer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>And where sits his friends? hath he not a prepard company of
gallants, to aplaud his iests, and grace out his play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>None I protest: Doe Poets vse to bespeake their Auditory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>The best in grace doe, and but for that, some that I know, had
neuer had their grace in Poetry till this day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then must our Author looke for a certaine disgrace, for he
is altogether vnfurnisht of such a friendly audience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he must lay his tryall vpon God and good wits. But why
doth he call his play <HI>The Ile of Gulls,</HI> it begets much expectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not out of any dogged disposition, not that it figures a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
certaine state, or priuate gouernment: farre be that supposition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="3"/>
the thought of any indifferent Auditor: and the argument beeing a
little string or Riuolet, drawne frō the full streine of the right wor∣thy
Gentleman, Sir <HI>Phillip Sydneys</HI> well knowne Archadea, con∣firmes
it: onely a Duke to make tryall of certaine experiments, re∣tyres
with his retinue into a Namelesse desart. Now as well for fashi∣on
sake, as that all those which haue to doe in that desart, are guld in
the reach of their hopes, therefore hee calls it, (and as hee presumes,
not improperlie) <HI>The Ile of Gulls.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>Out a question he hath promised thee some fee, thou pleadest
so hard for him, but and he be a right Poet hee will neuer performe
it. But what method obserues hee in his play, ist any thing Criticall?
Are Lawyers fees, and Cittizens wiues laid open in it: I loue to heare
vice anotomizd, &amp; abuse let blood in the maister vaine, is there any
great mans life charactred int?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>None I protest sir, only in the person of <HI>Dametas</HI> he expres∣ses
to the life the monstrous and deformed shape of vice, aswell to
beget a lothing of abuse, as that his villanie may giue the greater lu∣ster
to the vertuous dispositions of true-borne gentilitie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>All thats nothing to mee, and there be not Wormewood water
and Copperes int, Ile not like it, should <HI>Apollo</HI> write it, and <HI>Rosius</HI>
himselfe act it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie vpon thee, thou art too too Criticall: is there any good bau∣dry
int, iests of an ell deepe, and a fathome broad, good cuckolding,
may a couple of young-setters vp learne to doe well int? Giue me a
sceane of venery, that will make a mens spirrits stand on theyr typ∣toes,
and die his bloode in a deepe scarlet, like your <HI>Ouids Ars A∣mandi,</HI>
there flowes the true Spring-head of Poetry, and the verie
Christall fount of Parnassus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chast eares would neuer endure it sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Chast eares, now deafenes light vppon em, what should chast
eares doe at a play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3</SPEAKER>
<P>Tis strange now, I am of neither a both your opinions, I like
neither rayling nor baudry: no, giue mee a stately pend historie, as
thus, <HI>The rugged windes, with rude and ragged ruffes. &amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie vpont, meere Fustian; I had rather heare two good baudie
iests, then a whole play of such teare-cat thunderclaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas Gentlemen, how ist possible to content you? you will
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rayling, and inuectiues, which our Authour neither dares, nor
<PB REF="3"/>
affects: you baudy and scurrill iests, which neither becomes his mo∣destie
to write, nor the eare of a generous Auditory to heare: you
must ha swelling comparisons, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bumbast Epithites, which are as
fit for the body of a C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>edie, as <HI>Hercules</HI> shooe for the foote of a
Pygmey: yet all these we must haue, and all in one play; or tis alrea∣die
condemnd to the hell of eternall disgrace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>Looke toot, if there be not gall int, it shall not passe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be not baudie, tis impossible to passe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be both Criticall and baudy, if it be not high written, both
your Poet and the house to, loose a friend of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay I beseech you sir, if you be his friend, stand so to him
still, for he hath too many enemies already, in whose iudgements, he
and his labours stand excommunicate, as though vnworthy to pre∣sent
themselues in this assembly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<P>Enemies, nays foote then theres some hope in's play, for Enuie
neuer workes but against desert and merrit. If hee be enuied theres
some worth in him, and Ile see out his play for that onely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith and Ile see an act or two out, but I tell you afore-hand I
cannot see it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3</SPEAKER>
<P>Not see it out? your reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Fore God I lay in bed till past three a clock, slept out my din∣ner,
and my stomacke will toule to supper afore fiue, therefore you
must pardon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either see it all or none; for tis growne into a custome at
playes, if any one rise (especially of any fashionable sort) about what
serious busines soeuer, the rest thinking it in dislike of the play, tho
he neuer thinks it, cry mew, by Iesus vilde; and leaue the poore hart∣lesse
children to speake their Epilogue to the emptie seates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3</SPEAKER>
<P>Why doost thinke thy audience like a flock of sheepe, that one
cannot leape ouer a hedge, but all the rest will follow, they ha more
of reason in them then so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Ile sit out the play, and be but to auoyd that sheepish im∣putation,
but see it be baudy, or by this light I and all my friends will hisse.</P>

<L>Scornd of chast eares. If he compose a Sceane</L>
<L>Of high writ Poesie, fitting a true stage,</L>
<L>Tis counted fustian: If portick rage</L>
<L>Strike at abuse, or ope the vaine of sinne,</L>
<L>He is straight inform'd against for libelling.</L>
<L>Neither quick mirth, inuectiue, nor high state,</L>
<L>Can content all: such is the boundlesse hate</L>
<L>Of a confused Audience: Then we</L>
<L>That scarcely know the rules of Poesie</L>
<L>Cannot scape check. Yet this our comfort is,</L>
<L>The wise will smile to heare th' impartiall hiss.</L>
<L>We neither bragge, nor tremble, faint nor intreat,</L>
<L>Our merrits nothing, yet our hopes are great,</L>
<L>Yet this our Author bad me boldly speake,</L>

<SPEAKER>Basil:</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcom gallants, welcom honord bloods; the reason that
we haue vncloth'd vs of our princely gouernment in Arcadia, and
haue to doe with this priuate retirement heere in this defart Ile, you
shall find in that shedule, onely thus much for publique satisfaction:
Tis not strange to you, that the choisest treasure Nature indow'd vs
with, is mynde vp in the vaines of my two daughters: howe much
their quiet, and the smothe streame of our gouernment in Arcadia,
was troubled by the impetuous concourse of vnruly suters, is familiar
with your knowledge; this to auoide, I haue for my Image there in
my absence appointed my brother, and vndertooke this priuate re∣tirement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my lord, are you so couetous of your daughters beauties,
that their perfections shall be a meanes to hinder their preferment?</P>

<L>To which effect we haue sent a generall challenge</L>

<P>And the Presence were not exceeding empty-stomackt, it

<SPEAKER>1 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Captaine Obseruation, times bawde, thou that hast
kept the Ages doore, whilst vp-start basenes crept into the bedde of
greatnesse, what doost thou thinke of this change?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it pleasd the Duke, and becomes not subiects to ex∣amine
his actions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thats no part of my meaning, yet would I gladly be bet∣ter
instructed why the Duke broke vp his Court in Archadea, and
remoued it into this Iland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not Secretarie to his thoughts, but the generall m∣mour
is, that out of the freenes of his spirit, hee hath sent a challenge
to all his neighbor Princes, that who soeuer (within a twelue month)
can defeate him of his daughters, shall with theyr loues, inioy his
dukedome, the garland proposde for the victors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words throw sence into mee, and thats the cause the
Iland is so surely guarded with watch-towers, ouer which our selu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

and other Captaines haue the charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap</SPEAKER>
<P>And to the end, that not affection, but desart may prooue
victor, are the two Ladies so narrowly obserud, the one neuer out a

the Dukes chiefe director.</P>
</SP>

<P>If inquisitiuenesse be not too bolde a guest, what doe you
thinke of <HI>Dametas.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>As of a little hillock, made great with others ruines.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>1 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your comparison holds, for by report, his auarice has vn∣made
many to make him vp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did he first stumble on the Princes fauour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>As some doe vpon offices, by fortune and flatterie, or as
truth saies, the Prince hauing one day lost his way, wandring in the
woods found this <HI>Dametas,</HI> affected his discourse, tooke him along
to the Court, and like great men in loue with their owne dooings,
countenanct his defects, gaue him offices, titles, and all the additions
that g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the making vp of a man worshipfull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot but commend the Duke for raysing him, nor
yet praise him, that he proportions not his carriage aunswerable to
his fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Your thoughts and mine are twynnes in that: but I heare
the warning bell, some strangers are ariued.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lets to our office then, and conduct them to <HI>Dametas,</HI>
whose custome is to spet &amp; hem, whilst his scribe <HI>Maior</HI> takes they<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>You play well Sir, but you loose still.</P>

<P>Pollecie <HI>Manasses,</HI> pollicie, for when any man vpbraides

<P>Faith sir according to the proportion of it, little or nothing
they say tis a banckrout, and dares not shew his head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let em leaue resting at me, though it please the Duke
for some fewe good parts that he sees in me, to make me his familiar,

</SP>
<STAGE>put vp their papers.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1 Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>That fellowes pocket is like a Taylers hell, it eates vp part

that would I squirt awongst beggerlie Tennants: Some against
Vsurers, and that would I throw in at Prison Grates amongst
prodigall Banqeoutes: Some against the pride of the Court,
and that honies the eare of the Citizen: Some against the fraude
of the Citie, and that's Cake and Cheese to the Countrie: Some
against Protestants, and that's plumpes the lasie Catholicke a∣gainst
