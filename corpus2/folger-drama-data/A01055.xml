<L>Good man, wee both haue shar'd enough of sadnes:</L>
<L>Though thine ha's tasted deeper of th'extreme;</L>
<L>Let vs forget it henceforth. Where's the picture</L>
<L>I sent yee? Keepe it, tis a counterfeit,</L>
<L>And in exchange of that, I ceaze on this,</L>
<L>The reall substance: with this other hand</L>
<L>I giue away before her Fathers face</L>
<L>His younger ioy, <HI>Cleophila,</HI> to thee</L>
<L>Cousin <HI>Amethus</HI>: take her, and be to her</L>
<L>More then a Father, a deseruing husband.</L>
<L>Thus rob'd of both thy children in a minute,</L>
<L>Thy cares are taken off.</L>

<L>I am a weake old man, so poore and seeble,</L>
<L>That my vntoward ioynts can scarcely creepe</L>
<L>Vnto the graue, where I must seeke my rest.</L>
