<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Spirits!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT will seem strange to you that we should beg a Pardon from you before you know a Crime committed; But such is our <HI>harsh Fate,</HI> that we shall want as much of your <HI>Mercie</HI> to the for∣giving of this sad presumption of offering to your view these few <HI>poor</HI> sheets, the <HI>Rich Remains</HI> of our too-long-since lost Friend, M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>FLETCHER,</HI> as we shall your favourable <HI>Acceptance,</HI> and <HI>Incouragement</HI> in it. The Play was of so Generall a receiv'd Acceptance, that (he <HI>Him∣self</HI> a <HI>Spectator</HI>) we have known him un-concern'd, and to have wisht it had been none of His; He, as well as the <HI>throng'd Theatre</HI> (in despight of his innate Modesty) Applauding this <HI>rare issue of his Brain.</HI> His <HI>Complacencie</HI> in his own Work, may be, per∣haps no Argument to you of the Goodness of the Play, any more than our <HI>Confidence</HI> of it; and we do not expect our <HI>En∣comium</HI> can do any thing with you, when the Play it self is so near: That will <HI>commend</HI> it self unto you. And now Farewell our <HI>Glory</HI>! Farewell your <HI>Choice Delight,</HI> most noble Gentlemen! Farewell th' <HI>Grand Wheel</HI> that set <HI>Vs</HI> smaller Motions in Action! Farewell the Pride and Life o'th' Stage! Nor can we (though in our Ruin) much repine that we are so little, since <HI>He</HI> that gave us being is no more.</P>
<P><HI>Generous Soules!</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not unknown unto you All, how by a cruell Destinie we have a long time been <HI>Mutes</HI> and <HI>Bound,</HI> although our Miseries have been sufficiently <HI>Clamorous</HI> and <HI>Expanded,</HI> yet till this hap∣py opportunitie, never durst vex your open Ears and Hands: But this we're confident of will be the surest Argument for your <HI>Noblesses.</HI> What an Ingenious Person of Qualitie once spake of his <HI>Amours,</HI> we apply to our necessities,

<L>Than Words, though ne'r so Wittie:</L>

<HEAD>ON Mr. FLETCHERS excellent Play, THE WILD-CHASE CHASE.</HEAD>
<L>ME thinkes I see thy <HI>angred ashes</HI> rise</L>
<L><HI>FLETCHER</HI>; I feel them smarting in my eyes.</L>
<L>Methinks thou sayst what would this rimer have</L>

<L>Me thinkes (like that <HI>Old Moralist's</HI> Complaint</L>
<L>What ill of mine has gain'd this ill mans prayse?</L>
<L>I hear thee say, sure this Play has some taint</L>
<L>That this ill Poet gives his withered bayes?</L>
<L>Perhaps this good <HI>Philosophers</HI> life began</L>
<L>To make the <HI>ill</HI> man <HI>good</HI>; As in a man</L>
<L>To love the good's a step to being so,</L>
<L>Love to thy <HI>Muse</HI> may be to me so too;</L>
<L>Then I shall know how to commend thy Muse</L>
<L>When her own self the prayses shall infuse:</L>
<L>Till then I must sit down confess the <HI>wonder,</HI></L>
<L>'Bove which I <HI>cannot</HI> go, and, <HI>wont</HI> goe <HI>under.</HI></L>
<L>But where's the prayse (you 'I say) to <HI>FLETCHERS</HI> wit?</L>
<L>I would ha giv'n but had no Offering fit.</L>
<L>Then let these lines be thought to <HI>FLETCHERS Muse</HI></L>

<L>I left your Portion in <HI>La-Castres</HI> hands,</L>

</SP>

<L>I am glad to hear it: But I pre'thee tell me,</L>
<L>(And tell me true) what end had you <HI>Oriana,</HI></L>
<L>In trusting your money here? He is no Kinsman,</L>
<L>Nor any tie upon him of a Guardian;</L>
<L>Nor dare I think ye doubt my prodigality.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Or.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, certain, Sir, none of all this provoked me;</L>
<L>Another private reason.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>de G.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis not private,</L>
<L>Nor carryed so: 'tis common (my fair Sister)</L>
<L>Your love to <HI>Mirabell</HI>; your blushes tell it:</L>
<L>'Tis too much known, and spoken of too largely;</L>
<L>And with no little shame I wonder at it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Or.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is it a shame to love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>de G.</SPEAKER>
<L>To Love undiscreetly:</L>
<L>A Virgin should be tender of her honour,</L>
<L>Close, and secure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Or.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am as close as can be,</L>
<L>And stand upon as strong and honest guards too,</L>
<L>Unless this Warlike Age need a Port-cullis:</L>
<L>Yet I confess, I love him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Hear the people.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Or.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now I say hang the people: He that dares</L>

<L>His Mother, nay his own Wife up to Rumor;</L>
<L>All grounds of truth they build on, is a Tavern,</L>
<L>And their best censure's Sack, Sack in abundance:</L>
<L>For as they drink, they think: they ne'r speak modestly</L>
<L>Unless the wine be poor, or they want money.</L>
<L>Beleeve them? beleeve <HI>Amadis de Gaul,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Knight</HI> o'th' <HI>Sun,</HI> or <HI>Palmerin</HI> of <HI>England</HI>;</L>
<L>For these, to them, are modest, and true stories.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>Pray understand me; if their tongues be truth,</L>
<L>And if in <HI>Vino veritas</HI> be an Oracle,</L>
<L>What woman is, or has been ever honest?</L>
<L>Give 'em but ten round cups, they'll swear <HI>Lucretia</HI></L>
<L>Dy'd not for want of power to resist <HI>Tarquine,</HI></L>
<L>But want of Pleasure, that he stayd no longer:</L>
<L>And <HI>Portia,</HI> that was famous for her Pietie</L>
<L>To her lov'd Lord, they'll face ye out, dy'd o'th' pox.</L>
</SP>

<L>Well, there is something, Sister.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>If there be, Brother,</L>
<L>'Tis none of their things, 'tis not yet so monstrous;</L>
<L>My thing is Mariage: And at his return</L>
<L>I hope to put their squint-eyes right again.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>de G.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mariage? 'tis true: his father is a rich man;</L>
<L>Rich both in land and money: he his heir,</L>
<L>A young and handsom man, I must confess too;</L>
<L>But of such qualities, and such wild flings,</L>
<L>Such admirable imperfections, Sister,</L>
<L>(For all his travaile, and bought experience)</L>
<L>I should be loth to own him for my brother:</L>
<L>Me thinks a rich mind in a state in different</L>
<L>Would prove the better fortune.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Or.</SPEAKER>
<L>If he be wild,</L>
<L>The reclaming him to good, and honest (brother)</L>
<L>Will make much for my honor; which, if I prosper,</L>
<L>Shall be the study of my love, and life too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>de G.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ye say well; would he thought as well, and loved too.</L>
<L>He mary? he'll be hang'd first: he knows no more</L>
<L>What the conditions and the ties of Love are,</L>
<L>The honest purposes and grounds of Mariage,</L>
<L>Nor will know, nor be ever brought t' endeavour,</L>
<L>Than I do how to build a Church; he was ever</L>
<L>A loose and strong defier of all order,</L>
<L>His Loves are wanderers, they knock at each door,</L>
<L>And tast each dish, but are no residents:</L>
<L>Or say he may be brought to think of Mariage</L>
<L>(As 't will be no small labour) thy hopes are strangers.</L>
<L>I know there is a labour'd match, now follow'd,</L>
<L>(Now at this time, for which he was sent for home too)</L>
<L>Be not abus'd, <HI>Natolet</HI> has two fair daughters,</L>
<L>And he must take his choice.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Or.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let him take freely;</L>
<L>For all this I despair not: my mind tells me</L>
<L>That I, and onely I, must make him perfect;</L>
<L>And in that hope I rest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>de G.</SPEAKER>
<L>Since y' are so confident</L>
<L>Prosper your hope: I'll be no adversary:</L>

<L>That's nothing,</L>

<L>A Cobler out of mouldy cheese perform it,</L>
<L>Cabbage, and coarse black bread: me thinks a Gentleman</L>
<L>Should take foul scorn to have a Nawl out-name him.</L>
<L>Two at a birth? why every House-dove has it:</L>
<L>That man that feeds well, promises as well too,</L>

<L>That is, be honest, modest: I would have him valiant,</L>

<L>Travail'd he should be, but through himself exactly;</L>
<L>For 'tis fairer to know manners well, than Countries;</L>
<L>He must be no vain talker, nor no Lover</L>

<L>My happiness is in mine own content,</L>

<L>Give me a good free fellow, that sticks to me,</L>

<L>If either of these two women were offer'd to me now,</L>

<L>I put 'em off, because I lov'd 'em not,</L>
<L>Because they are too queazie for my temper,</L>
<L>And not for thy sake, nor the Contract sake,</L>
<L>Nor vows, nor oathes, I have made a thousand of 'em,</L>
<L>They are things indifferent, whether kept or broken;</L>
<L>Meer veniall slips, that grow not near the Conscience;</L>
<L>Nothing concerns those tender parts; they are trifles;</L>

<L>What should I mary for? Do I want any thing?</L>
<L>Am I an inch the farther from my pleasure?</L>
<L>Why should I be at charge to keep a wife of mine own,</L>
<L>When other honest maryed men will ease me?</L>
<L>And thank me too, and be beholding to me:</L>
<L>Thou thinkst I am mad for a Maiden-head, thou art cozen'd;</L>
<L>Or if I were addicted to that diet</L>
<L>Can you tell me where I should have one? thou art eighteen now,</L>

<L>I never love to deal withall: Do'st thou see this book here?</L>
<L>Look over all these ranks; all these are Women,</L>
<L>Mayds, and pretenders to Maiden-heads; these are my conquests,</L>
<L>All these I swore to mary, as I swore to thee,</L>
