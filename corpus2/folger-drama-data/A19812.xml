<HEAD>The Argument.</HEAD>
<P>VPon the second agreement (the
first being broken through iea∣lousie
of a disproportion of emi∣nencie)
betweene the <HI>Triumuiti
Octauius Caesar, Marcus Anto∣nius,</HI>
and <HI>Lepidus: Octauia</HI> the
sister of <HI>Octauius Caesar,</HI> was ma∣ried
to <HI>Antonius,</HI> as a linke to combine that which
neuer yet, the greatest strength of nature, or anie po∣wer
of nearest respect could long hold togither, who
made but the instrument of others endes, and de∣liuered
vp as an Ostage to serue the oportunity of ad∣uantages,
met not with that integritie she brought:
but as highly preferred to affliction encountred with
all the greeuances that beat vpon the misery of great∣nesse,
exposed to stand betwixt the diuers tending
humours of vnquiet parties. For <HI>Antonie</HI> hauing yet
vpon him the fetters of AEgipt, layde on by the pow∣er
of a most incomparable beauty, could admit no new
lawes into the state of his affection, or dispose of him∣selfe
being not himselfe, but as hauing his heart tur∣ned
Eastward whither the point of his desires were
directed, toucht with the strongest allurements that
ambition, and a licencious soueraintie could draw a
man vnto: could not truly descend to the priuate loue
<PB REF="4"/>
of a ciuill nurtred. Matrone, whose entertainment
bounded with modesty and the nature of her educa∣tion,
knew not to cloth her affections in any other colours
then the plain habit of truth: wherein she euer suted al
her actions<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and vsed all her best ornaments of honesty,
to win the good liking of him that helde her but as a
Curtaine drawne betweene him and <HI>Octauius</HI> to sha∣dow
his other purposes withall; which the sharpe sight of
an equally iealous ambition could soone pierce into, &amp;
as easily looke thorow and ouer bloud and nature as he
to abuse it: And therefore to preuent his aspiring, he
armes his forces either to reduce <HI>Antonie</HI> to the ranke
of his estate, or else to disranke him out of state and al.
When <HI>Octauia</HI> by the imployment of <HI>Antonie</HI> (as be∣ing
not yet ready to put his fortune to her triall) throwes
her selfe, great with childe, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> big with sorrow, into
the trauaile of a most laboursome recon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iliacion: ta∣king
her iourney from the farthest parte of <HI>Greece</HI> to
find <HI>Octauius,</HI> with whom her care and teares were so
good agents that they effected their Commission be∣yond
all expectation, and for that time quite disarmed
their wrath, which yet long could not hold so. For <HI>Anto∣nius</HI>
falling into the relaps of his former disease, watch∣ing
his oportunity got ouer again into <HI>Egypt,</HI> where he
so forgot himselfe, that he quite put off his owne nature,
and wholy became a pray to his pleasures, as if hee had
wound himselfe out of the respect of Country, bloud &amp;
alliance, which gaue to <HI>Octauia</HI> the cause of much af∣fliction,
and to me the Argument of this letter.</P>

<HEAD>The Argument.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the death of <HI>Antonius, Cleo∣patra,</HI>
(liuing still in the Monument
she had caused to be built,) could
not, by any meanes be drawne foorth,
although <HI>Octauius Caesar</HI> very ear∣nestly
laboured it: and sent <HI>Proculei∣us,</HI>
to vse all dilligence to bring her
vnto him: for that he thought it would bee a great Orna∣ment
to his Triumphes, to get her aliue to Rome. But ne∣uer
would she put her selfe into the hands of <HI>Proculeius,</HI>
although on a time hee found the meanes, (by a window
that was at the toppe of the Monument) to come downe
vnto he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> where hee perswaded her (all hee might) to
yeelde her selfe to <HI>Caesars</HI> mercy. Which shee, (to be ridde
of him,) cunningly seemed to grant vnto. After that, <HI>Oct∣auius</HI>
in person went to visit her, to whom she excused her
offence, laying all the fault vpon the greatnes, and feare
she had of <HI>Antonius,</HI> and withall, seemed very tractable,
and willing to be disposed of by him.</P>
<P>Wherevpon <HI>Octauius,</HI> (thinking himselfe sure) re∣solued
presently to send her away to Rome. Whereof, <HI>Do∣labella,</HI>
a fauourite of <HI>Caesars,</HI> (and one that was growne
into some good liking of her ) hauing certified her, shee
makes her humble petition to <HI>Caesar,</HI> that he would suffer
<PB REF="14"/>
her to sacrifice to the ghost of <HI>Antonius</HI>: which being grā∣ted
her, she was brought vnto his sepulchre, where, after
her rites performed, she returned to the monument, and
there dined with great magnific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce. And in dinner time,
came there one in the habite of a countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man, with a bas∣ket
of Figs vnto her, who (vnsuspected) was suffered to
carry them in. And in that Basket (among the Figges)
were conueyed the Aspickes wherewith she did her selfe
to death. Dinner being ended, she dispatched Letters to
<HI>Caesar,</HI> containing great lamentations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with an earnest sup∣plication,
that she might be intombed with <HI>Antonius.</HI>
Whereupon <HI>Caesar</HI> knowing what she intended, sent pre∣sently
with all speede, Messengers to haue preuented her
death, which notwithstanding, before they came, was dis∣patched.</P>
<P><HI>Caesario</HI> her sonne, which she had by <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> (con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eyed
before vnto India, out of the danger of the warres)
was about the same time of her death, murthered at
Rhodes: trained thither by the falshoode of his Tutor,
corrupted by <HI>Caesar.</HI> And so, hereby came the race of the
<HI>Prolomies</HI> to be wholy extinct, and the flourishing rich
kingdome of Egypt vtterly ouerthrowne and subdued.</P>

<L>The spot where-with my kinde &amp; youth did staine it.</L>
<L>My body found a graue where to containe it.</L>
<L>A sheete could hide my face, but not my sin,</L>
<L>For Fame findes neuer tombe t'inclose it in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And which is worse, my soule is now denied,</L>

most valiant of the <HI>Greekes:</HI>
patient of trauaile, excee∣ding
bountifull, and one that loued his men
and friends better then any Noble-man of
the Campe: but otherwise noted of vaine-glorie
and prodigallitie, in so much as his fa∣ther
hauing notice of his carriage, warned
him to make himselfe lesse then he was, to
auoide the enuie of the Campe, and the dis∣like
of the King, who grew suspicious of him
in respect of the greatnesse of his Father,

of certaine vaunts of his vsed to
<HI>Antigona</HI> a fayre Curtizan borne in the cittie

fall many braue wordes, and bostes of a Sol∣dier,
to aduance his owne actions and his
fathers, terming <HI>Alexander</HI> at euery worde
the young man. Which speeches <HI>Anti∣gona</HI>

<L>There is one <HI>Dymnus</HI> here within the campe:</L>

<L>Seeme to haue thrust him int'outragious wayes.</L>
<L>This man affecting one <HI>Nichomacus</HI></L>
<L>A youth, my brother, whom one day h'allures</L>
<L>Int'a temple where being both alone,</L>
<L><PB REF="76"/>He breakes out in this sort: <HI>Nichomacus</HI></L>
<L>Sweete louely youth, ah should I not impart</L>
<L>To thee the deepest secrets of my hart,</L>
<L>My hart that hath no lock shut against thee,</L>
<L>Would let it out some-times vnwares of me.</L>
<L>But as it issues from my faithfull loue,</L>
<L>So close it vp in thine, and keepe it fast:</L>
<L>Sweare to be secret deere <HI>Nichomacus.</HI></L>
<L>Sweare by the sacred God-head of this place</L>
<L>To keepe my councell, and I will reueale</L>
<L>A matter of the greatest consequence</L>
<L>That euer man imparted to his friend.</L>
<L>Youth and desire drawne with a loue to know,</L>
<L>Swore to be secret, and to keepe it close</L>
<L>When <HI>Dymnus</HI> tells him, that within three dayes</L>
<L>There should b'effected a conspiracie</L>
<L>On <HI>Alexanders</HI> person, by his meanes</L>
<L>And diuers more of the Nobillitie.</L>
<L>To free their labours and redeeme them home,</L>
<L>Which when <HI>Nichomacus</HI> my brother heard:</L>
<L>Is this your tale saith he? O God forbid</L>
<L>Mine oath should tie my tongue to keepe in this.</L>
<L>This ouglie sinne of treason, which to tell</L>
<L>Mine oath compells me, faith against my faith</L>

<L><HI>Dymnus</HI> amaz'd hearing beyond conceipt</L>
<L>The self-willd youth vow to reueale their plot:</L>
<L>Stands staring on him, drawing back his breath,</L>
<L>Or els his breath confounded with his thoughts</L>
<L><PB REF="76"/>Bufied with death and horror, could not worke,</L>
<L>Not hauing leasure now, to thinke what was</L>
<L>But what would be, his feares were runne before,</L>

<L>At length yet, when his reason had reduc'd</L>
<L>His flying thoughts back to some certaine stand,</L>
<L>Perceiuing yet some distance was betwixt</L>
<L>Death and his feares which gaue him time to worke,</L>
<L>With his returning spirits he drew his sword,</L>
<L>Puts it t'his owne then to my brothers throate,</L>
<L>Then layes it downe, thē wrings his hands, thē kneeles.</L>
<L>Then stedfast lookes, then takes him in his armes,</L>
<L>Weepes on his neck, no word, but O wilt thou?</L>
<L>Wilt thou, be the destruction of vs all?</L>
<L>And finding no relenting in the youth.</L>
<L>His milerie grew furiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and againe</L>
<L>He takes his sworde, and sweares to sacrifice</L>
<L>To silence and their cause, his dearest bloud.</L>
<L>The boy amaz'd, seeing no other way,</L>
<L>Was faine to vow, and promise secrecie;</L>
<L>And as if wonne t'allow and take that part,</L>
<L>Prayes him to tell, who were his complices.</L>
<L>Which, though perplext with grief for what was done,</L>

<L>Now good my friend I pray thee tell vs how.</L>

<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>As willing to relato as you to heare</L>
<L>A full-chargd hart is glad to finde an eare.</L>
<L>The Councell being dimissd from hence, and gone,</L>
<L>Still <HI>Craterus</HI> plyes the King, still in his eare,</L>
<L>Still whispering to him priuately alone,</L>
<L>Vrging it seemd a quick dispatch of feare:</L>
<L>For they who speako but priuately to Kings,</L>
<L>Do seldome speake the best and fittest things.</L>
<L>Some would haue had him forthwith ston'd to death.</L>
<L>According to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> course:</L>
<L>But yet that would not satisfie the breath</L>
<L>Of busie rumour; but would argue force,</L>
<L>There must be some confessions made within,</L>
<L>That must abrode more satisfaction minne.</L>
<L><HI>Craterus</HI> with <HI>Caenus</HI> and <HI>Ephestion,</HI></L>
<L>Do mainely vrge to haue him tortured,</L>
<L><PB REF="107"/>Whereto the king consents, and there vppon</L>
<L>They three are sent to see't accomplished.</L>
<L>Racks, Yrons, Fires, the grisely torturers</L>
<L>Stand hidcously prepard before his face.</L>
<L><HI>Philotas</HI> all vnmou'd, vnchaungd appeares,</L>
<L>As if<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he would, deathes ougliest brow out-face,</L>
<L>And skornd the worst of force, and askt them why</L>
<L>They staid to torture the kings enemy.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cho.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>That part was acted well, God grant we heare</L>
<L>No worse a Scene then this, and all goes cleare.</L>
<L>So should worth act, and they who dare to fight</L>
<L>Against corrupted times should dye vpright:</L>
<L>Such harts kings may dissolue but not defeat,</L>
<L>Agreat man where he falles he should lye great</L>
<L>Whose ruine (like the sacred carkeses</L>
<L>Of skattred temples which still reuerent lio,</L>

<L>Straight were hote-yrons appli'd to sere his flesh,</L>
<L>Then wresting racks, his comely body straine:</L>
<L>Then yron whipps and then the rack a-fresh,</L>
<L>Then fire againe, and then the whipps againe:</L>
<L>Which he indures with so resolud a looke</L>
<L>As if his mind were of another side</L>
<L>Then of his body, and his sence for sooke</L>
<L>The part of nature, to be wholy tyde</L>
<L>To honor, that he would not once consent</L>
<L>So much as with a sight' his punishment.</L>

<L>Yet doth he like himselfe yet all is well.</L>
<L><PB REF="108"/>This Argument no tyrant can refell,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nu,</SPEAKER>

<L>I must tell all, and therefore giue nie leaue,</L>
<L>Swolne with raw tumors, vlcered with the ierk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</L>
<L>Of Iron whips, that slesh from bene had raz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</L>
<L>And no part free from wounds; it erkes</L>
<L>His soule to see the house so foule defast,</L>
<L>Wherein his life had dwelt so long time clene,</L>
<L>And therefore craues he, they would now dismisse</L>
<L>His grieuous tortures, and he would begin</L>
<L>To open all wherein h'had donne amisse.</L>
<L>Streight were his tortures ceast, and after they</L>
<L>Had let him to recouer sense he said,</L>
<L>Now <HI>Craterus</HI> say, what you will haue me say?</L>
<L>Wherewith as if deluded, or delaid,</L>
<L><HI>Cratetus</HI> in wrath calles presently againe,</L>
<L>To haue the tortures to be reapplied.</L>
<L>When what soeuer secret of his hart</L>
<L>Which had bene fore-conceiued but in athought</L>
<L>What friend soeuer had but tooke his part</L>
<L>In common loue h'accus'd; and so forgot</L>
<L>Himselfe that now he was more forward to</L>

<L>Whether affliction had his spirits vndonne,</L>
<L>Or seeing to hide or vtter was all one;</L>
<L>Both waies lay death, and therefore he would vie</L>
<L>Now to be sure to say enough to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd then began his fortunes to deplore</L>
<L>Humbly besought them, whom he skornd before,</L>
<L>That <HI>Alexander</HI> where he stood behind</L>
<L>A Trauers, out of sight, was heard to speake:</L>
<L>I neuer thought a man that had a mind</L>
<L>T'attempt so much, had had a heart so weake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There he confest that one <HI>Hegelochus,</HI></L>
<L>When first the King proclaimd himselfe <HI>Ioues</HI> sonne:</L>
<L>Incene'd his fathers heart against him thus,</L>
<L>By telling him that now we were vndone,</L>
<L>If we indur'd, that he which did disdaine</L>
<L>To haue beene <HI>Philips</HI> sonne, should liue and raigne.</L>
<L>He that aboue the state of man will straine</L>
<L>His stile, and will not be that which we are,</L>
<L>Not onely vs contemnes, but doth disdaine</L>
<L>The godds themselues, with whom he would compare,</L>
<L>We haue lost <HI>Alexander,</HI> lost (said he)</L>
<L>The King; and falue on pride and vanitie:</L>
<L>And we haue made a God of our owne bloud,</L>
<L>That glorisies himselfe, neglects our good.</L>
<L>Intollerable is this impious deed,</L>
<L>To Godds, whom he would match, to men he would exceed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus having over-night <HI>Hegelochus</HI></L>
<L>Discoursd: my father sends next day</L>
<L>For me to heare the same: and there to vs</L>
