He playes one o'the <HI>Arches,</HI> that dwels about the <HI>Hospitall,</HI> and hee has a very pretty part. But for the whole <HI>Play,</HI> will you ha'the truth on't? (I am looking, lest the <HI>Poet</HI> heare me, or his man, Master <HI>Broome,</HI> behind the Arras) it is like to be a very conceited scuruy one, in plaine English.

<P>ARTICLES of Agreement, indented, between the <HI>Spectators</HI> or <HI>Hearers,</HI> at the <HI>Hope</HI> on the Bankeside, in the County of <HI>Surrey</HI> on the one party; And the <HI>Author of Bartholmew Fayre</HI> in the said place, and County on the o∣ther party: the one and thirtieth day of <HI>Octob.</HI> 1614. and in the twelfth yeere of the Raigne of our Soueragine Lord, IAMES by the grace of God <HI>King of England, France, &amp; Ire∣land,</HI> Defender of the faith. And of <HI>Scotland</HI> the seauen and fortieth.</P>
<P>INPRIMIS, It is couenanted and agreed, by and be∣tweene the parties abouesaid, and the said <HI>Spectators,</HI> and <HI>Hearers,</HI> aswell the curious and enuious, as the fauouring and iudicious, as also the grounded Iudgements and vn∣derstandings, doe for themselues seuerally Couenant, and agree to remaine in the places, their money or friends haue put them in, with patience, for the space of two houres and an halfe, and somewhat more. In which time the <HI>Author</HI> promiseth to present them by vs, with a new suf∣ficient Play called BARTHOLMEW FAYRE, merry, and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none. Prouided they haue either, the wit or the honesty to thinke well of themselues.</P>
<P>It is further agreed that euery person here, haue his or their free-will of censure, to like or dislike at their owne charge, the <HI>Author</HI> hauing now departed with his right: It shall bee lawfull for any man to iudge his six pen'orth his twelue pen'orth, so to his eighteene pence, 2. shillings, halfe a crowne, to the value of his place: Prouided alwaies his place get not aboue his wit. And if he pay for halfe a
<PB REF="6"/>
dozen, hee may censure for all them too, so that he will vndertake that they shall bee silent. Hee shall put in for <HI>Censures</HI> here, as they doe for <HI>lots</HI> at the <HI>lottery</HI>: mary if he drop but sixe pence at the doore, and will censure a crownes worth, it is thought there is no conscience, or iustice in that.</P>
<P>It is also agreed, that euery man heere, exercise his owne Iudgement, and not censure by <HI>Contagion,</HI> or vp∣on <HI>trust,</HI> from anothers voice, or face, that sits by him, be he neuer so first, in the <HI>Commission of Wit</HI>: As also, that hee bee fixt and settled in his censure, that what hee approues, or not approues to day, hee will doe the same to morrow, and if to morrow, the next day, and so the next weeke (if neede be:) and not to be brought about by any that sits on the <HI>Bench</HI> with him, though they indite, and arraigne <HI>Playes</HI> daily. Hee that will sweare, <HI>Ieronimo,</HI> or <HI>Andronicus</HI> are the best playes, yet, shall passe vnexcepted at, heere, as a man whose Iudgement shewes it is constant, and hath stood still, these fiue and twentie, or thirtie yeeres. Though it be an <HI>Ignorance,</HI> it is a vertuous and stay'd ignorance; and next to <HI>truth,</HI> a confirm'd errour does well; such a one the <HI>Author</HI> knowes where to finde him.</P>
<P>It is further couenanted, concluded and agreed, that how great soeuer the expectation bee, no person here, is to expect more then hee knowes, or better ware then a <HI>Fayre</HI> will affoord: neyther to looke backe to the sword and buckler-age of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> but content himselfe with the present. In stead of a little <HI>Dauy</HI>; to take toll o'the Bawds, the <HI>Author</HI> doth promise a strut∣ting <HI>Horse-courser,</HI> with a <HI>leere</HI>-Drunkard, two or three to attend him, in as good <HI>Equipage</HI> as you would wish. And then for <HI>Kinde-heart,</HI> the Tooth-drawer, a fine oyly <HI>Pig-woman</HI> with her <HI>Tapster,</HI> to bid you welcome, and a consort of <HI>Roarers</HI> for musique. A wise <HI>Iustice</HI> of <HI>Peace meditant,</HI> in stead of a <HI>Iugler,</HI> with an <HI>Ape.</HI> A ciuill <HI>Cutpurse searchant.</HI> A sweete <HI>Singer</HI> of new Bal∣lads
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>allur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI>: and as fresh an <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> as euer was broach'd <HI>rampant.</HI> If there bee neuer a <HI>Seruant-monster</HI> i'the <HI>Fayre</HI>; who can helpe it? he sayes; nor a nest of <HI>Antiques</HI>? Hee is loth to make Nature afraid in his <HI>Playes,</HI> like those that beget <HI>Tales, Tempests,</HI> and such like <HI>Drolleries,</HI> to mixe his head with other mens heeles; let the concupisence of <HI>Iigges</HI> and <HI>Dances,</HI> raigne as strong as it will amongst you: yet if the <HI>Puppets</HI> will please any body, they shall be entreated to come in.</P>
<P>In <HI>consideration of which,</HI> it is finally agreed, by the fore∣said hearers, and <HI>spectators,</HI> that they neyther in themselues conceale, nor suffer by them to be concealed any <HI>State-decipherer,</HI> or politique <HI>Picklocke</HI> of the <HI>Scene,</HI> so solemn∣ly ridiculous, as to search out, who was meant by the <HI>Ginger-bread-woman,</HI> who by the <HI>Hobby-horse-man,</HI> who by the <HI>Costard-monger,</HI> nay, who by their <HI>Wares.</HI> Or that will pretend to affirme (on his owne <HI>inspired igno∣rance</HI>) what <HI>Mirror of Magistrates</HI> is meant by the <HI>Iu∣stice,</HI> what <HI>great Lady</HI> by the <HI>Pigge-woman,</HI> what <HI>con∣ceal'd States-man,</HI> by the <HI>Seller</HI> of <HI>Mouse-trappes,</HI> and so of the rest. But that such person, or persons so found, be left discouered to the mercy of the <HI>Author,</HI> as a for∣feiture to the <HI>Stage,</HI> and your laughter, aforesaid. As al∣so, such as shall so desperately, or ambitiously, play the foole by his place aforesaid, to challenge the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> of scurrilitie, because the language some where sauours of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> the Booth, and the Pig-broath, or of prophanenesse, because a <HI>Mad-man</HI> cryes, <HI>God quit you,</HI> or <HI>blesse you.</HI> In <HI>witnesse</HI> whereof, as you haue preposterously put to your Seales already (which is your money) you will now adde the other part of suffrage, your hands, The <HI>Play</HI> shall presently begin. And though the <HI>Fayre</HI> be not kept in the same Regi∣on, that some here, perhaps, would haue it, yet thinke▪ that therein the <HI>Author</HI> hath obseru'd a speciall <HI>Decorum,</HI> the place being as durty as <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and as stinking euery whit.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/><HI>Howsoeuer,</HI> hee prayes you to beleeue, his <HI>Ware</HI> is still the same, else you will make him iustly suspect that hee that is so loth to looke on a <HI>Baby,</HI> or an <HI>Hob∣by-horse,</HI> heere, would bee glad to take vp a <HI>Commodity</HI> of them, at any laugh∣ter, or losse, in ano∣ther place.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BVS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verily, for the disease of longing, it is a disease, a carnall disease, or appetite, incident to women: and as it is carnall, and incident, it is naturall, very naturall: Now Pigge, it is a meat, and a meat that is nourishing, and may be long'd for, and so conse∣quently eaten; it may be eaten; very exceeding well eaten: but in the <HI>Fayre,</HI> and as a <HI>Bartholmew</HI>-pig, it cannot be eaten, for the very calling it a <HI>Bartholmew</HI>-pigge, and to eat it so, is a spice of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and you make the <HI>Fayre,</HI> no better then one of the high <HI>Places.</HI> This I take it, is the state of the question.

<P>Surely, it may be otherwise, but it is subiect, to constru∣ction, subiect, and hath a face of offence, with the weake, a great

face, a foule face, but that face may haue a vaile put ouer it, and be shaddowed, as it were, it may be eaten, and in the <HI>Fayre,</HI> I take it, in a Booth, the tents of the wicked: the place is not much, not very much, we may be religious in midst of the prophane, so it be eaten with a reformed mouth, with <HI>sobriety,</HI> and humblenesse; not gorg'd in with gluttony, or greedinesse; there's the feare: for, should she goe there, as taking pride in the place, or delight in the vncleane dressing, to feed the vanity of the eye, or the lust of the palat, it were not well, it were not fit, it were abominable, and not good.</P>

<P>I will make no more orations, shall draw on these tragicall con∣clusions. And I begin now to thinke, that by a spice of collate∣rall Iustice, <HI>Adam Ouerdoo,</HI> deseru'd this beating; for I the said <HI>Adam,</HI> was one cause (a by-cause) why the purse was lost: and my wiues brothers purse too, which they know not of yet. But I shall make very good mirth with it, at supper, (that will be the sport) and put my little friend, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Humphrey Wasp's</HI> choler quite out of counte∣nance. When, sitting at the vpper end o'my Table, as I vse, &amp; drink∣ing to my brother <HI>Cokes,</HI> and M<SUP>rs</SUP>. <HI>Alice Ouerdoo,</HI> as I wil, my wife, for their good affectiō to old <HI>Bradley,</HI> I deliuer to'hem, it was I, that was cudgell'd, and shew 'hem the marks. To see what bad euents may peepe out o'the taile of good purposes! the care I had of that ciuil yong man, I tooke fancy to this morning, (and haue not left it yet) drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company, indeeede, which drew the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut-purse; which drew the money; which drew my brother <HI>Cokes</HI> his losse; which drew on <HI>Wasp's</HI> anger; which drew on my beating: a pretty gradation! And they shall ha' it i'their dish, i'faith, at night for fruit: I loue to be merry at my Ta∣ble. I had thought once, at one speciall blow he ga'me, to haue re∣uealed my selfe? but then (I thank thee fortitude) I remembred that a wise man (and who is euer so great a part, o'the Common-wealth in himselfe) for no particular disaster ought to abandon a publike good designe. The husbandman ought not for one vn∣thankful yeer, to forsake the plough; The Shepheard ought not, for one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not for one leake i'the poope, to quit the Helme; Nor the Alderman ought not for one custerd more, at a meale, to giue vp his cloake; The Constable ought not to breake his staffe, and forsweare the watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper o'the Parish (<HI>Vt par∣uis componere magna solebam</HI>) to put vp his pipes, for one rainy Sunday. These are certaine knocking conclusions; out of which, I am resolu'd, come what come can, come beating, come imprison∣ment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discouer who I am, till my due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I said euer, in Iustice name, and the King's, and for the Common-wealth.</P>
