<HEAD>To the right Vertuous and truly noble Gentleman, <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> IO. REED</HI> of Mitton, in the Countie of Glo∣cester Esquire.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR,</HI> if any worke of this nature be worth the presenting to Friends Worthie, and Noble; I presume this, will not want much of that value. Other Countrie men haue thought the like worthie of Dukes and Princes acce∣ptations; <HI>Iniusti sdegnij; Il Pentamento Amorose; Calisthe, Pastorfido, &amp;c.</HI> (all being but plaies) were all dedicate to Princes of Italie. And therefore only discourse to shew my loue to your right vertuous and noble disposition; This poor Comedie (of many desired to see printed) I thought not vtterly vnworthie that affectionate designe in me: Well knowing that your free iudgement weighs nothing by the Name, or Forme; or any vaine estimation of the vulgar; but will accept acceptable matter, as well in Plaies; as in many lesse materialls, masking in more serious Titles. And so, till some worke more worthie I can select, and per∣fect, out of my other Studies, that may better expresse me; and more fit the grauitie of your ripe inclination, I rest.</P>

<P>Faith no worse then I did last weeke, the weather has nothing chang'd the graine of your complexion.</P>

<P>But is there no obiect in this suite to whet your tongue vpon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, but Fortune send you well to weare it: for shee best knowes how you got it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, 'tis the portion shee bestowes vpon yonger Brothers, valour, and good clothes: Marry, if you aske how we come by this new suite, I must take time to answere it: for as the Ballad saies, in written Bookes I find it. Brother these are the blossomes of spirit: and I will haue it said for my Fathers honour, that some of his children were truly begotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not all?</P>

<P>Shall I tell you brother that I know will reioyce you? my former suites haue been all spenders, this shall be

<P>A thing to bee heartily wisht; but brother, take heede you be not gull'd, be not too forward.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>'T had beene well for me, if you had follow'd that counsaile: You were too forward when you stept into the world before me, and gull'd me of the Land, that my spi∣rits and parts were indeede borne too.</P>

<P>May we not haue the blessing to know the aime of your fortunes, what coast, for heauens loue?</P>

<P>May we not know't?</P>

<P>Not vnlesse you'le promise mee to laugh at it, for without your applause, Ile none.</P>
</SP>

<P>The qualitie of it may bee such as a laugh will not be ill bestow'd vpon't; pray heauen I call not <HI>Arsace</HI> sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynth.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? the Pandresse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know you (as who knowes not) the exquisite La∣die of the Palace? The late Gouernours admired Widdow? The rich and haughtie Countesse <HI>Eudora?</HI> Were not shee a Iewell worth the wearing, if a man knew how to win her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that? how's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, there is a certaine Goddesse called <HI>Confi∣dence,</HI> that carries a maine stroke in honourable prefer∣ments. Fortune waits vpon her; <HI>Cupid</HI> is at her becke; shee sends them both of errands. This Deitie doth promise me much assistance in this businesse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if this Deitie should draw you vp in a basket to your Countesses window, and there let you hang for all the wits in the Towne to shoot at: how then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If shee doe, let them shoote their bolts and spare not: I haue a little Bird in a Cage here that sings me better comfort. What should be the barre? you'le say, I was Page to the Count her husband. What of that? I haue there by one foote in her fauour alreadie; Shee has taken note of my spirit, and suruaid my good parts, and the picture of them liues in her eie: which sleepe, I know, can not close, till shee haue embrac't the substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this sauors of the blind Goddesse you speake of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I despaire, but that <HI>Cupid</HI> hath one dart in store for her great Ladiship, as well as for any other huge Ladie, whom she hath made stoope Gallant, to kisse their worthie followers. In a word, I am assured of my speede. Such faire attempts led by a braue resolue, are e∣uermore seconded by Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynth.</SPEAKER>
<P>But brother? haue I not heard you say, your own eares haue been witnesse to her vowes, made solemnely to your late Lord; in memorie of him, to preserue till death,
<PB REF="5"/>
the vnstain'd honour of a Widdowes bed. If nothing else, yet that might coole your confidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tush sister, suppose you should protest with so∣lemne oath (as perhaps you haue done, if euer Heauen heares your praiers, that you may liue to see my Brother nobly interred) to feede only vpon fish, and not endure the touch of flesh, during the wretched Lent of your mi∣serable life; would you beleeue it Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am therein most confident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you had better beleeue it then trie it: but pray Sister tell me, you are a woman: doe not you wiues nod your heads, and smile one vpon an other when yee meete abroade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smile? why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As who should say, are not we mad Wenches, that can lead our blind husbands thus by the noses? do you not brag amongst your selues how grosly you abuse their ho∣nest credulities? how they adore you for Saints: and you beleeue it? while you adhorne their temples, and they be∣leeue it not? how you vow Widdow-hood in their life time, and they beleeue you, when euen in the sight of their breathlesse corse, ere they be fully cold, you ioine embraces with his Groome, or his Phisition, and perhaps his poiso∣ner; or at least by the next Moone (if you can expect so long) solemnely plight new Hymineall bonds, with a wild, confident, vntamed Ruffine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And make him the top of his house, and soueraign Lord of the Palace, as for example. Looke you Brother, this glasse is mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>While I am with it, it takes impression from my face; but can I make it so mine, that it shall bee of no vse to any other? will it not doe his office to you or you: and as well to my Groome as to my selfe? Brother, Monopo∣lies are cryed downe. Is it not madnes for me to beleeue, when I haue conquer'd that Fort of chastitie the great
<PB REF="5"/>
Countesse; that if another man of my making, and mettall, shall assault her: her eies and eares should lose their fun∣ction, her other parts their vse, as if Nature had made her all in vaine, vnlesse I only had stumbl'd into her quar∣ters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cynth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother: I feare mee in your trauaile, you haue drunck too much of that Italian aire, that hath infected the whole masse of your ingenuous Nature; dried vp in you all sap of generous disposition, poisond the very Es∣sence of your soule, and so polluted your senses, that what∣soeuer enters there, takes from them contagion, and is to your fancie represented as foule and tainted, which in it selfe perhaps is spotlesse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No sister, it hath refin'd my senses, and made mee see with cleare eies, and to iudge of obiects, as they truly are, not as they seeme, and through their maske to di∣scerne the true face of thinges. It tells me how short liu'd Widdowes teares are, that their weeping is in truth but laughing vnder a Maske, that they mourne in their Gownes, and laugh in their Sleeues, all which I be∣leeue as a Delphian Oracle: and am resolu'd to burne in that faith. And in that resolution doe I march to the great Ladie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysand.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lose time Brother in discourse, by this had you bore vp with the Ladie and clapt her aboord, for I knowe your confidence will not dwell long in the ser∣uice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I will performe it in the Conquerours stile. Your way is, not to winne <HI>Penelope</HI> by suite, but by surprise. The Castle's carried by a sodaine assault, that would perhaps sit out a twelue-moneths siege. It would bee a good breeding to my yong Nephew here, if hee could procure a stand at the Palace, to see with what alacritie Ile a-coast her Countesship, in what garbe I will woo her, with what facilitie I will winne her.</P>
</SP>

<P>'TIs miraculous that you tell me Sir: he come to woo our Ladie Mistris for his wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a phrensie he is possest with, and wil not be cur'd but by some violent remedie. And you shall fauour me so much to make me a spectator of the Scene. But is shee (say you) alreadie accessible for Suiters? I thought shee would haue stood so stifly on her Widdow vow, that shee would not endure the sight of a Suiter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith Sir, <HI>Penelope</HI> could not barre her gates against
<PB REF="6"/>
her woers, but shee will still be Mistris of her selfe. It is as you know, a certaine Itch in femall bloud, they loue to be su'd to: but sheele hearken to no Suiters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>But by your leaue <HI>Lycus, Penelope</HI> is not so wise as her husband <HI>Vlysses,</HI> for he fearing the iawes of the <HI>Syren,</HI> stopt his eares with waxe against her voice. They that feare the Adders sting, will not come neare her hissing. Is any Suiter with her now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Spartan Lord, dating himselfe our great Viceroies Kinsman, and two or three other of his Countrie Lords, as spots in his train. He comes armed with his Altitudes letters in grace of his person, with promise to make her a Du∣chesse if shee embrace the match. This is no meane attra∣ction to her high thoughts; but yet shee disdaines him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how then shall my brother presume of accep∣tance? yet I hold it much more vnder her contentment, to marrie such a Nastie braggart, then vnder her honour to wed my brother: A Gentleman (though I sai't) more ho∣nourably descended than that Lord: who perhaps, for all his Ancestrie would bee much troubled to name you the place where his Father was borne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I hold no comparison betwixt your brother &amp; him. And the Venerean disease, to which they say, he has beene long wedded, shall I hope first rot him, ere shee en∣dure the sauour of his Sulphurous breath. Well, her Ladi∣ship is at hand; y'are best take you to your stand.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, but with a medicine ten parts more dangerous then the sicknesse: how know you strange his dotage euer was on his wife; taking speciall glorie to haue her loue and loialtie to him so renowm'd abrode. To whom shee often∣times hath vow'd constancie after life, till her owne death had brought forsooth, her widdow-troth to bed. This he ioi'd in strangely, and was therein of infallible beliefe, till your surmise began to shake it; which hath loos'd it so, as now there's nought can settle it, but a triall, which hee's resolu'd vpon.</P>

<P>Thankes for this newes i' faith. This may perhaps proue happie to my Nephew. Truth is I loue my sister well and must acknowledge her more then ordinarie vertues. But shee hath so possest my brothers heart with vowes, and disauowings, seal'd with oathes of second nuptialls; as in that confidence, hee hath inuested her in all his state, the ancient inheritance of our Familie: and left my Nephew and the rest to hang vpon her pure deuotion; so as he dead, and shee matching (as I am resolu'd shee will) with some yong Prodigall; what must ensue, but her post-issue beg∣gerd, and our house alreadie sinking, buried quick in ruin. But this triall may remoue it, and since tis come to this; marke but the issue <HI>Lycus,</HI> for all these solemne vowes, if I doe not make her proue in the handling as weake as a wa∣fer; say I lost my time in trauaile.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sthe.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twere a sinne to suspect her; I haue been witnesse to so many of her fearfull protestations to our late Lord a∣gainst that course, to her infinite oathes imprinted on his lips, and seal'd in his heart with such imprecations to her bed, if euer it should receiue a second impression, to her o∣pen and often detestations of that incestuous life (as shee term'd it) of widdowes marriages, as being but a kinde of lawfull adulterie; like vsurie permitted by the law, not ap∣prou'd. That to wed a second, was no better then to cuc∣kold the first: That women should entertaine wedlock as one bodie, as one life, beyond which there were no desire, no thought, no repentance from it, no restitution to it. So as if the conscience of her vowes should not restraine her, yet the worlds shame to breake such a constant resolution, should represse any such motion in her.</P>

<P>Well, for her vowes, they are gone to heauen with her husband, they binde not vpon earth: And as for Wo∣mens resolutions, I must tell you, The Planets, &amp; (as <HI>Ptolo∣mie</HI> saies) the windes haue a great stroke in them.

<P>True Madam; O fie vpon am, they are intollerable.

<P>But hast thou no shame? No sense of what disdain I shew'd thee in my last entertainment? chacing thee from my presence, and charging thy dutie, not to attempt the like intrusion for thy life; and dar'st thou yet approch mee in this vnmannerly manner? No question this desperate boldnesse can not choose but goe accompanied with other infinite rudenesses.</P>

<P>Faith fellow <HI>Lycus,</HI> if my wager were weakely built, this vnexpected accident might stagger it▪ For the truth is, this strain is extraordinarie, to follow her husbands bodie into the Tombe, and there for his companie to burie her selfe quick: it's new and stirring, but for all this, Ile not despaire of my wager.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, can you thinke such a passion dissembl'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>All's one for that, What I thinke I thinke; In the meane time forget not to write to my Brother, how the plot hath succeeded, that the newes of his death hath ta∣ken; a funerall solemnitie perform'd, his suppos'd Corse bestow'd in the monument of our Familie, thou and I hor∣rible mourners: But aboue all that his intollerable vertuous Widow, for his loue; (and for her loue) <HI>Ero</HI> her hand-maid, are discended with his Corse into the vault; There wipe their eies time out of minde, drinke nothing but their own teares, and by this time are almost dead with famine. There's a point will sting it (for you say tis true) where left you him?</P>

<P>Well Sir, but for this iealous humour that hants him.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Performe it, call you it? you may iest; men hunt Hares to death for their sports, but the poore beasts die in earnest: you wager of her passions for your pleasure, but shee takes little pleasure in those earnest passions. I neuer saw such an extasie of sorrow, since I knew the name of
<PB REF="25"/>
sorrow. Her hands flew vp to her head like Furies, hid all her beauties in her discheuel'd haire, &amp; wept as she would turne fountaine. I would you and her husband had beene behind the Arras but to haue heard her. I assure you Sir, I was so transported with the spectacle, that in despight of my discretion, I was forc't to turne woman, and beare a part with her. Humanitie broke loose from my heart, and stream'd through mine eies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>In prose, thou weptst. So haue I seen many a moist Auditor doe at a play; when the storie was but a meere fi∣ction: And didst act the Nuntius well, would I had heard it: could'st thou dresse thy lookes in a mournefull habite?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas well; and could not show but strangely.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, This tale pronounc't with terrour, suited with action clothed with such likely circumstance; My wounds in shew, her husbands herse in sight, thinke what effect it wrought: And if you doubt, let the sad conse∣quence of her retreat to his Tombe, bee your wofull in∣structer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<L>For all this, Ile not despaire of my wager: These</L>
<L>Grieues that sound so lowd, proue alwaies light,</L>
<L>True sorrow euermore keepes out of sight.</L>
<L>This straine of mourning with Sepulcher, like an ouer-do∣ing Actor, affects grosly, and is indeede so farre forc't from the life, that it bewraies it selfe to be altogether artificiall.</L>
<L>To set open a shop of mourning! Tis palpable.</L>
<L>Truth, the substance, hunts not after the shadow of popular</L>
<L>Fame. Her officious ostentation of sorrow condemnes her sinceritie. When did euer woman mourne so vnmeasura∣bly,
<PB REF="26"/>
but shee did dissemble?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Gods! a passion thus borne; thus apparell'd with teares, sighes, swownings, and all the badges of true sor∣row, to be dissembl'd! by <HI>Venus</HI> I am sorrie I euer set foot in't. Could shee, if shee dissembl'd, thus dally with hunger, be deafe to the barking of her appetite, not hauing these foure daies relieu'd nature with one dramme of su∣stenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For this does shee looke to bee Deified, to haue Hymnes made of her, nay to her: The Tomb where she is to be no more reputed the ancient monument of our Fami∣lie the <HI>Lysandri</HI>; but the new erected Altar of <HI>Cynthia</HI>: To which all the Paphian widdowes shall after their husbands Funeralls, offer their wet muckinders, for monuments of the danger they haue past, as Sea-men doe their wet gar∣ments at <HI>Neptunes</HI> Temple after a ship wracke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Ile apprehend you, at your pleasure: I for my part will say; that if her faith bee as constant as her loue is heartie, and vnaffected, her vertues may iustly challenge a Deitie to enshrine them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, there's an other point too. But one of those ver∣tues is enough at once. All natures are not capable of all gifts. If the braine of the West, were in the heads of the learned; then might Parish-Clerkes be common counsaile men, and Poets Aldermens deputies. My sister may turne <HI>Niobe</HI> for loue; but till <HI>Niobe</HI> bee turn'd to a Marble, Ile not despaire but shee may proue a woman. Let the triall runne on, if shee doe not out-runne it, Ile say Poets are no Prophets, Prognosticators are but Mountibankes, &amp; none tell true but wood-mongers.

This negligence will by the Gouernour be wholly cast on me, he hereby will suggest to the Viceroy, that the Citie guards are very caresly attended. He loues mee not I know; because of late I knew him but of meane condition; but now by fortunes iniudicious hand, guided by bribing Courtiers, hee is rais'd to this high seate of honour. Nor blushes he, to see him selfe ad∣uanc't ouer the heads of ten times higher worths; but takes it all forsooth, to his merits; and lookes (as all vpstarts doe) for most huge obseruance. Well, my mind must stoope to his high place, and learne within it selfe to seuer him from that, and to adore Authoritie the Goddesse, how euer borne by an vn∣worthie beast; and let the Beasts dull apprehension take the honour done to <HI>Isis,</HI> done to himselfe.

What should be the riddle of this? that he is stolne hether into a Souldiers disguise? he should haue staid at Dipolis to receiue news from vs. Whe∣ther he suspected our relation; or had not patience to expect it, or whether that furious, frantique capricious Deuill iealousie hath tost him hether on his hornes, I can not coniecture.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>So we may chide the fire for burning vs; or say the Bee's not good because she stings; Tis not the body the law respects, but the souldiers neglect; when the watch (the guard and safetie of the Citie) is left abandon'd to all hazards.
