<L>Am I not Titled Prince of all the World?</L>

<L>In search of which men hazard dangerous Seas,</L>

<L>'Tis confirm'd; I see the Divell yet hath more honesty</L>
<L>Then hath his Son, the Usurer; for to him</L>

<L>He counts them meere impostures, falacyes,</L>

<P>Then 'tis desperate?</P>
</SP>

<L>Not so; for comming from the Friery late,</L>
<L>I met a man by chance that cross'd my way,</L>
<L>Whom rather too much spirit had possess'd,</L>
<L>Or too much folly made meere desperate;</L>
<L>Would willingly attempt it, and indeed</L>
<L>He did intreat it of me as a Suite.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reason mov'd him to't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Because he's mad:</L>
<L>For who of understanding, or of sence,</L>
<L>Would willingly confront great <HI>Belzebub,</HI></L>
<L>Perhaps despaire, distraction, discontent</L>

<L>What e're betide me.</L>
<L>Good night to you: see the doores lockt and bolted,</L>
<L>That's all I shall enjoyne you; till we meete</L>
<L>A faire and prosperous Morning: did I know</L>
<L>What object I should meet with, I could then</L>
<L>Fit me unto the plunge accordingly,</L>
<L>And arme me for the Grapple; but of this</L>
<L>I nothing can conjecture: oh but that Parchment</L>
<L>By which I am oblig'd to pay a soule,</L>
<L>The memory of that is horrible,</L>
<L>And strikes me with affright: what can I ghesse,</L>
<L>But that this is my divells Stratagem,</L>
<L>To have his Serjeant death arrest me heere;</L>
<L>And beare me to that cursed Dungeon, Hell?</L>
<L>An Usurer would doe't; any fat Serjeant</L>
<L>That lookes as plumpe in cheekes as th'other leane;</L>
<L>Then why not these? their gaine's but petty trash,</L>
<L>But these the precious riches of a soule;</L>
<L>Yet in these Hell-hounds have I greater trust</L>
<L>Than in those Doggs of th'Earth, for I am sure</L>
<L>The Divell himselfe can be no Usurer,</L>
<L>He is so free of his purse; and hitherto</L>
<L>Hath lent his money gratis: Ile to Bed,</L>
<L><PB REF="34"/>And yet I will not; I'me no whit dismay'd,</L>
<L>Nor yet at peace within; disquieted</L>
<L>With sudden feares, nor yet well reconcil'd:</L>
<L>Ile try if I can sleepe; and yet not so,</L>
<L>Lest I be taken napping; yet Ile throw me</L>
<L>Upon the Bed and reade.</L>
<STAGE>Ent. Divells dauncing, with Fire wokes, and Crackers.</STAGE>
<L>Hey, hey, the Divells daunce, sure Hell's broke loose?</L>
<L>And this is their Shrove Tuesday; hornes upon you,</L>
<L>And that's the Cuckolds curse; yet this was sport,</L>
<L>Though somewhat fearefull: had they proffer'd violence,</L>
<L>This should have thrash'd among them, but it seemes</L>
<L>These were no quarreling spirits; yet howsoe're,</L>
<L>I am glad they are gone: what object shall be next?</L>
<L>Musicke? yet this sounds sweeter than the first,</L>
<L>For that was all of discords.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Ent. two Maides with Banquet and Lights; after courtesies to him, they fetch in</HI> Anne, <HI>and place her at the Table against him.</HI></STAGE>
<L>What, in Hell are there white Divells, Angels are</L>
<L>These of Light, or but light Angels? Banquet too?</L>
<L>And Feast? the furies in the lower World</L>
<L>I thought till now had fed on hot meates all;</L>
<L>On parboyl'd Murtherers, Usurers roasted flesh,</L>
<L>Whores cheekes for dainties, Carbonado'd o're</L>
<L>Red sulphurous Gridions, and a thousand such:</L>
<L>But what's she enters now? to whom the rest</L>
<L>Doe such obeysance? place her in her State,</L>
<L>As if she were the Queene grim <HI>Pluto</HI> stole,</L>
<L>And great <HI>Alcides</HI> once redeem'd from Hell?</L>
<L>Be'st thou Ghost, shadow, Fuery, Fiend, or Hag,</L>

<L>What art thou? speake, do'st answer me in smiles?</L>
<L>Why do'st thou beckon me? point to those shadowes,</L>
<L>As were the meates essentiall! had I a stomacke,</L>
<L>With thee I durst not eate: do'st laugh at me?</L>
<L>Oh hadst thou but a substance to that presence</L>
<L>I'de dare on thee, wert thou th' infirnall Dam.</L>
<L>Temptation still? Ile thinke her what she seemes,</L>
<L>For no affright can lodge in her faire looke,</L>

<L>Sit there? I will; eate? but begin Ile do't:</L>
<L>Faine would I take her by the hand, but feare</L>
<L>Hers rather would melt mine, than melt in mine:</L>
<L>Why should my sence of touching thus turne Coward?</L>
<L>My eyes being so valiant, can you speake?</L>
<L>Oh such a wife through all the world I'de wish,</L>
<L>That would be ever Tongue-ty'd; reach your hand?</L>
<L>I would and gladly too; s'foot I will venture,</L>
