his head and neighed, and after his maner laught as heartily
as if a mare had bene tyed to his girdle. My masters, said I,
it is no laughing matter; for if my master take you here, you
goe, as round as a top, to the pound. Another vntoward
iade hearing me threaten him to the pound, and to tell you
of them, cast vp both his heeles, and let such a monstrous
great fart; that was as much as in his language to say, A fart
for the pound, and a fart for George a Greene. Nowe I
