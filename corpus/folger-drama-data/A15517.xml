<L>This blessing is not my sole benefit,</L>

<PB REF="30"/>
Why my suite, looke yee, is such a suite, as you are bound in honor to heare, for it is for the puppet like wealth, I would haue no new or∣ders, nor new sciences set vp in the citie, whereof I am a poore frée∣man, and please ye, as ye may read in my bil ther, <HI>simplicity fréeman.</HI> But my Lords, I would haue three old trades, which are not for the common wealth, put downe.</P>

<P>Why foole, tis for thy good to giue thée money for that, that might lie and rust by thée.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No my Lord, no. I may not call you foole: it is to marke the houses where such stuffe is, that against rebels rise, there is harneis and weapon ready for them in such and such houses, and what then? the rustie weapon doth wound past surgerie, and kils the Quéens good subiects: &amp; the rest of the old trash wil make them guns too, so it is good luck to find old yron, but tis naught to keep it, and the trade is crafty, and now my L. <HI>pollicy,</HI> I speak to you, t'were wel to put it downe.</P>

<P>Wisely said, which is your second? Is that as perillous?</P>
</SP>

<P>Yea, and worse: It is, haue ye any ends of gold and silue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? this is a perilous trade, couetous, and a ticement to murther, for, marke ye, If they that aske this should be euill giuen, as Gods forbod▪ they sée who hath this gold and siluer, may not they come in the night breake in at their houses, and cut their throates for it?

<P>O do you not perceiue the subtiltie? why sir, the Woodmongers hires these poore men to goe vp and downe with their betles &amp; wed∣ges on their backs, crieng, haue ye any wood to cleaue, and laugh to see them trauell so loden with wood and yron: now sir, if the poore men go two or thrée daies and be not set a worke (as sometimes they doo) the Woodmongers pay them and gaine by it, for then know they there's no wood in the citie, then raise they the price of billets so bie, that the poore can buy none. Now sir, if these fellowes were barr'd from as∣king, whether there were wood to cleaue or not, the woodmongers néed not know but that there were wood, and so billets and fagots woulde be sold al at one rate, downe with this trade, we shall sit a cold els my Lords.</P>
