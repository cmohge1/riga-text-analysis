<L>WHat good gift of God but may be misused?</L>
<L>Nay what good thing newe but to euill is applye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Howe is the Scripture with many abused</L>
<L>With mouth it is talked, but with liuing denyed</L>
<L>What iewel it is the iust haue well tryed</L>
<L>For if that be a Iewell that comfortes in care</L>
<L>Than this is a iewell of other most rare.</L>
<L>It is the consolacion of the repentant sinner</L>
<L>It is the chiefe comfort of Christes persecuted</L>
<L>The faithfull and wronged person haue therein pleasure</L>
<L>The penitent which are with pouertie oppressed</L>
<L>Thereby are made richer then the couetous and wicked</L>
<L>For it is our Euidence of all our ioye and saluation</L>
<L>Whereby we are certified that Christe hath payd our raunsome.</L>
<L>Thereby many godly sciences needefull be studied</L>
<L>Whereof the bodie hath onely the fruition</L>
<L>As the Physicall arte whereby the sicke are cured.</L>
<L>Musicke through whose harmonie the minde hath consolation.</L>
<L>Cosmographi which describes the countrie, citie and Nacion.</L>
<L>Geometri, through whose subtill arte and measuring</L>
<L>At this day there is much costly and sumptuouse building.</L>
<L>The pleasant science of Astrologie whereby Gods wonderfull workes</L>
<L>Are rather to be marked then mused on, or meruayled:</L>
<L>Which arte is not hidde from the Sarisons, Paganes and Turkes</L>
<L>Whereby such starres and heauens they may knowe were not created</L>
<L>But by a mightie God, whose name for euer be honoured.</L>
<L>And the moouing of the Planetes to be learned very strange</L>
<L>With the swifte course of the Moone who monethly keepes her change.</L>
<L>Yet all other sciences with these before delated</L>
<L>Shall vanishe as the smoke, and be nothing at length</L>
<L>Yet heauenlie Theologie, Gods worde before declared</L>
<L>Hath bene, is nowe, and euer of such force and strength</L>
<L>That though heauen and earth perishe, as Christes woordes meaneth</L>
<L>Yet his worde shall abyde and remayne for euer:</L>
<L>The following whereof God graunt we endeuer.</L>
<L>Notwithstanding Epicures and belly goddes so swarme</L>
<L>Farced, and flowing with all kinde of euill</L>
<L>That they feare not to doe any kinds of harme</L>
<L>So much they fauour their father the deuill</L>
<L>The Scripture is taken with them as no Iewell</L>
<L>Their mindes are so much on their riches and goods</L>
<L>That the learned they esteeme lesse then fooles that weare hoods.</L>
<L>But if the learned be riche, then be they esteemed:</L>
<L>Not for their learning but for their goodes sake.</L>
<L>Such power haue riches and money obteyned</L>
<L>That the riche are helde vppe, the poore fooles in the lakes</L>
<L>God giue them grace not so much on goodes to make:</L>
<L><HI>Diues</HI> me thinkes might be to them a warning,</L>
<L>For pleasure therein, lyeth nowe in hell burning.</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>What mettayle is this money that makes men so mad?</L>
<L>What mischiefe is it thereby is not wrought?</L>
<L>What earthly thing is not therefore to be had?</L>
<L>What hath bene so loued but money hath bought?</L>
<L>What vertue or goodnes of vs so much sought,</L>
<L>Who doth not wishe for money, and that euery day:</L>
<L>I would I had thus much money eache one doth say.</L>
<L>Howe many for money haue bene robbed and murthered?</L>
<L>Howe many false witnes and for money periured?</L>
<L>Howe many wyues from their husbands haue bene enticed?</L>
<L>Howe many maydens to folly for money allured?</L>
<L>Howe many for money haue spirites and deuilles coniured?</L>
<L>Howe many friends for money haue bene mortall foes?</L>
<L>Mo mischieues for money then I can disclose.</L>
<L>Howe many Kings and Princes for money haue bene poysoned,</L>
<L>Howe many betrayers of their countrey for money euery day,</L>
<L>Howe many with money from true iudgement are led:</L>
<L>Did not the prophete Balam curse gods people for money?</L>
<L>Did not <HI>Iudas</HI> for money his master Christ betraye?</L>
<L>Whereof he had no ioye, when he the same had done,</L>
<L>But like a damned wretch honge him selfe full soone.</L>
<L>One asked <HI>Diogenes</HI> why golde did looke so wan:</L>
<L>No marueill said he it is though he so pale doe looke,</L>
<L>For euery one layes wayte to catche him if they can.</L>
<L>Fewe will take the paynes to catche holde on gods booke:</L>
<L>Money ill vsed is the diuels snare and hooke.</L>
<L>Whereby many are brought to endles damnation:</L>
<L>But the godly doe bestowe it to their saluation.</L>
<L>Fyer is the good gift and creature of God▪</L>
<L>Whereby we may do good and also wickedly:</L>
<L>We may warme the poore therewith as charitie hath vs bode,</L>
<L>And also seeth the meate wherewith to feede the hungrie:</L>
<L>We may keepe houses therewith, as many haue done truely:</L>
<L>And we may cut our necessaries and meate with our knyfe</L>
<L>Wherewith many haue cut their owne throtes &amp; bereued thē of their life.</L>
<L>Thus the creature of God is not euill of him selfe,</L>
<L>But through our misuse from good to euill conuerted:</L>
<L>Euen so money ill vsed is a most wicked pelfe.</L>
<L>And also as good where well it is, bestowed.</L>
<L>Let all people take heede lest it of them be hoarded:</L>
<L>For at the last day against them it will witnes,</L>
<L>And then that they had not done it, to late for to wishe.</L>
<L>And because that euery man of money is so greedie</L>
<L>Our Authour a pleasant Tragedie with paynes hath now made,</L>
<L>Whereby you may peceyue, All thing is for money:</L>
<L>For <HI>Omnia pecunia effici possunt,</HI> as in <HI>Tullies</HI> sentence is said▪</L>
<L>In hearing vs attentiuely we craue but your ayde,</L>
<L>Beseeching God, the hearers that thereby shalbe touched,</L>
<L>May rather amend their faultes, then therewith be grieued.</L>

<L>My name is called Arte, wherein is vsed much vyce:</L>
<L>All occupacions and artes which daily nowe are wrought</L>
<L>By me are represented throughout the whole earth,</L>
<L>Euerie one for money me daily haue sought:</L>

<L>O Iudas, Iudas, thereby thy selfe thast damned:</L>

<L>Pecunia voluptatis perimitur maximae,</L>
<L>The meaning whereof I may thus discusse</L>
<L>Most great pleasures be brought forth for money:</L>
<L>Then if money bring pleasure, pleasure brings forth sinne</L>
<L>And sinne bringes damnation vnlesse Gods grace we winne.</L>

<L>And giues them selues so much to the loue of money,</L>
<L>Let vs walke as we ought in praysing Gods name,</L>
<L>Beseeching God to sende them his fauour and mercie:</L>
<L>O Lorde blesse thy people from euerlasting miserie.</L>

<L>My learning as good as yours I dare be bolde to compare,</L>
