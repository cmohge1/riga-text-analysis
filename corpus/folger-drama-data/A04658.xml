<L>I meant a definition. For I make</L>
<L>The efficient cause, what's beautifull, and faire.</L>
<L>The formall cause, the appetite of vnion.</L>
<L>The finall cause, the vnion it selfe.</L>
<L>But larger, if you'l haue it, by description,</L>
<L>It is a flame, and ardor of the minde,</L>

<L>The he, or she, that loues, engraues, or stamps</L>

The formes of their belou'd, and them reflect,</L>
<L>It is the likenesse of affections,</L>
<L>Is both the parent, and the nurse of loue.</L>
<L>Loue is a spirituall coupling of two soules,</L>

<L>They are the earthly, lower forme oflouers,</L>

<L>Who dwels there, and inhabiteth the house?</L>
<L>There is my friendship to be made, within;</L>
<L>With what can loue me againe: not, with the walles,</L>
<L>Dores, windo'es, architrabes, the frieze, and coronice.</L>
<L>My end is lost in louing of a face,</L>
<L>An eye, lip, nose, hand, foot, or other part,</L>
<L>Whose all is but a statue, if the mind</L>
<L>Moue not, which only can make the returne.</L>
<L>The end of loue is, to haue two made one</L>
<L>In will, and in affection, that the mindes</L>

<L>The bodyes loue is fraile, subiect to change,</L>

<L>One, and the same, proceedeth first, from weighing,</L>
<L><PB REF="41"/>
And well examining, what is faire, and good;</L>
<L>Then, what is like in reason, fit in manners;</L>
<L>That breeds good will: good will desire of vnion.</L>
<L>So knowledge first, begets beneuolence,</L>
<L>Beneuolence breeds friendship, friendship loue.</L>
<L>And where it starts or steps aside from this,</L>
<L>It is a mere degenerous appetite,</L>
<L>A lost, oblique, deprau'd affection,</L>
<L>And beares no marke, or character of Loue.</L>

<L>Which are his modesty, and shamefac'tnesse:</L>
<L>And so they doe, that haue vnfit designes,</L>
<L>Vpon the parties, they pretend to loue.</L>
<L>For, what's more monstrous, more a prodigie,</L>
<L>Then to heare me protest truth of affection</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<L>So help me loue and my good sword at need.</L>
<L>It is the greatest vertue, and the safety</L>
<L>Of all mankinde, the obiect of it is danger.</L>
<L>A certaine meane 'twixt feare, and confidence:</L>
<L><PB REF="48"/>
No inconsiderate rashnesse, or vaine appetite</L>
<L>Of false encountring formidable thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</L>
<L>But a true science of distinguishing</L>
<L>What's good or euill. It springs out of reason,</L>
<L>And tends to perfect honesty, the scope</L>
<L>Is alwayes honour, and the publique good:</L>
<L>It is no valour for a priuate cause.</L>
</SP>

<L>No? not sor reputation?</L>

<L>That's mans Idoll,</L>

<L>Who hath commanded vs we should not kill;</L>
<L>And yet we say, we must for reputation.</L>
<L>What honest man can either feare his owne,</L>
<L>Or else will hurt anothers reputation?</L>
<L>Feare to doe base, vnworthy things, is valour,</L>
<L>If they be done to vs, to suffer them,</L>
<L>Is valour too. The office of a man</L>
<L>Thats truly valiant, is considerable</L>
<L>Three wayes: The first is in respect of <HI>matter,</HI></L>
<L>Which still is danger; in respect of <HI>forme,</HI></L>
<L>Wherein he must preserue his dignity;</L>

<L>Then it is not valour.</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> neuer thought an angry person valiant:</L>

<L>What need is there of anger, and of tumul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?</L>

Or phrensie if you will, doe these make valiant?</L>
<L>They are poore helps, and vertue needs them not.</L>

<L>How do's that differ from true valour?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus.</L>
<L>In the <HI>efficient,</HI> or that which makes it,</L>
<L>For it proceeds from passion, not from iudgement:</L>
<L>Then brute beasts haue it, wicked persons, there</L>
<L>It differs in the <HI>subiect:</HI> in the <HI>forme,</HI></L>
<L>'Tis carried rashly, and with violence:</L>
<L>Then i'the <HI>end,</HI> where it respects not truth,</L>
<L>Or publique honesty; but mere reuenge.</L>
<L>Now confident, and vndertaking valour,</L>
<L>Swayes from the true, two other wayes; as being</L>
<L>A trust in our owne faculties, skill, or strength,</L>
<L>And not the right, or conscience o'th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>cause,</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="49"/>
That workes it: Then i'the <HI>end,</HI> which is the victory,</L>
<L>And not the honour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bea.</SPEAKER>
<L>But the ignorant valour</L>
<L>That knowes not why it undertakes, but doth it</L>
<L>T'escape the infamy merely—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is worst of all:</L>
<L>That valour lies, i'the eyes o'the lookers on;</L>
<L>And is cal'd valour with a witnesse.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bea.</SPEAKER>
<L>Right:</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<L>The things true valour is exercis'd about,</L>
<L>Are pouerty, restraint, captiuity,</L>
<L>Banishment, losse of children, long disease:</L>
<L>The least is death. Here valour is beheld,</L>
<L>Properly seene; about these it is present:</L>
<L>Not triuiall things, which but require our confidence.</L>
<L>And, yet to those, we must obiect our selues,</L>
<L>Only for honesty: if any other</L>
<L>Respect be mixt, we quite put out her light.</L>
<L>And as all knowledge, when it is remou'd</L>
<L>Or separate from iustice, is cal'd craft,</L>
<L>Rather then wisdome: so a minde affecting,</L>
<L>Or vndertaking dangers, for ambition,</L>
<L>Or any selfe pretext, not for the publique,</L>
<L>Deserues the name of daring, not of valour,</L>
<L>And ouer-daring is as great a vice,</L>
<L>As ouer-fearing.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lat.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, and often greater.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<L>But as is not the mere punishment,</L>
<L>But cause that, makes a martyr, so it is not</L>
<L>Fighting, or dying; but the manner of it</L>
<L>Renders a man himselfe. A valiant man</L>
<L>Ought not to vndergoe, or tempt a danger,</L>
<L>But worthily, and by selected wayes:</L>
<L>He vndertakes with reason, not by chance.</L>
<L><PB REF="50"/>
His valour is the salt to his other vertues,</L>
<L>They are all vnseason'd without it. The waiting maids,</L>
<L>Or the concomitants of it, are his patience,</L>
<L>His magnanimity, his confidence,</L>
<L>His constancy, security, and quiet;</L>
<L>He can assure himselfe against all rumour!</L>
<L>Despaires of nothing! laughs at contumelies!</L>
<L>As knowing himselfe, aduanced in a height</L>
<L>Where iniury cannot reach him, nor aspersion</L>
<L>Touch him with soyle!</L>

<L>The purpose of an iniury 'tis to vexe</L>
<L>And trouble me: now, nothing' can doe that,</L>
<L>To him that's valiant. He that is affected</L>
<L>With the least iniury, is lesse then it.</L>
<L>It is but reasonable, to conclude</L>
<L>That should be stronger, still, which hurts, then that</L>
<L>Which is hurt. Now no wickednesse is stronger,</L>
<L>Then what opposeth it: Not Fortunes selfe,</L>
<L>When she encounters vertue, but comes off</L>
<L>Both lame, and lesse! why should a wise man then,</L>

<L>We are n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t so much troubled with the wrong,</L>
<L>As with the opinion of the wrong! like children,</L>
<L>We are made afraid with visors! Such poore sounds</L>
<L>As is the lie, or common words of spight.</L>
<L>Wise lawes thought neuer worthy a reuenge;</L>
<L>And 'tis the narrownesse of humane nature,</L>
<L>Our pouerty, and beggery of spirit,</L>
<L>To take exception at these things. He laugh'd at me!</L>
<L>He broke a iest! a third tooke place of me!</L>
<L>How most ridiculous quarrels are all these?</L>
<L>Notes of a queasie, and sick stomack, labouring</L>
<L>With want of a true iniury! the maine part</L>

<L>You take it rightly. If a woman, or child</L>

<L>No spice of a disgrace. No more is theirs,</L>
<L>If I will thinke it, who are to be held</L>
<L>In as contemptible a ranke, or worse.</L>
<L>I am kept out a Masque, sometime thrust out,</L>
<L>Made wait a day, two, three, for a great word,</L>
<L>Which (when it comes forth) is all frown, and forehead!</L>
<L>What laughter should this breed, rather then anger!</L>
<L>Out of the tumult, of so many errors,</L>

<L><PB REF="51"/>
If a great person doe me an affront,</L>
<L>A Giant of the time, sure, I will beare it</L>
<L>Or out of patience, or necessity!</L>
<L>Shall I doe more for feare, then for my iudgement?</L>
<L>For me now to be angry with <HI>Hodge Huffle,</HI></L>
