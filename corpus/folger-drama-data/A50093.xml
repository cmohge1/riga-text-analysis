<L>This from our Author, far from all offence,</L>
<L>To abler writers, or the Audience</L>
<L>Met here to judge his Poem. He by me</L>
<L>Presents his service, with such modesty</L>
<L>As well becomes his weakness. 'Tis no crime</L>
<L>He hopes as we do in this curious time,</L>
<L>To be a little diffident, when we are</L>
<L>To please so many with one Bill of Fare.</L>
<L>Let others, building on their merit, say</L>
<L>Y'are in the wrong, if you move not that way</L>
<L>Which they prescribe you, as you were bound to learn</L>
<L>Their maximes, but uncapable to discern</L>
<L>'Twixt truth and falshood Ours had rather be</L>
<L>Censur'd by some, for too much obsequy,</L>
<L>Then tax'd of self-opinion: If he hear</L>
<L>That his endeavors thriv'd, and did appear</L>
<L>Worthy your view though made so by your grace,</L>
<L>With some desert) he in another place</L>
<L>Will thankfully report, one Leaf of Bays</L>
<L>Truly confer'd upon this work, will raise</L>
<L>More pleasure in him, you the givers free,</L>

No forein, but intestine war: I have</L>

<L>A slave to passion, and am led captive</L>
<L>Before the battel's fought; I fainted when</L>

<L>True, Madam,</L>

She goes to the Vesper or the Mattins, hang me;</L>
<L>Or when she takes the air, be sure to find him</L>
<L>Near her coach; at her going forth, or coming back:</L>

<L>From all the rest of her train.</L>

<L>And with infinuation wrought my self</L>

<L>Ever a welcom guest. This noble Gentleman</L>
<L>Was bless'd with one fair daughter, (so he thought</L>

<L>The good <HI>Octavio</HI> no sooner fell</L>
<L>In the displeasure of his Prince, his state</L>
<L>Confiscated, and he forc'd to leave the Court,</L>
<L>And she expos'd to want; but all my oaths</L>

<L>AFter twice putting forth to Sea, his Fame</L>
<L>Shipwrack'd in either, and his once known Name</L>
<L>In two years silence buried, perhaps lost</L>

<L>(A zealous sacrifice to <HI>Neptune</HI> made</L>
<L>For good success in his uncertain trade)</L>
<L>Our Author weighs up anchors, and once more</L>
<L>Forsaking the security of the shore,</L>
<L>Resolves to prove his fortune: What 'twill be,</L>
<L>Is not in him, or us to prophesie;</L>
<L>You only can assure us. Yet he pray'd</L>
<L>This little in his absence might be said,</L>
<L>Designing me his Orator. He submits</L>
<L>To the grave censure of those abler Wits</L>
<L>His weakness; nor dares he profess that when</L>
<L>The Critiques laugh, he'l laugh at them agen.</L>
<L>(Strange self-love in a writer!) He would know</L>
<L>His errors as you find 'em, and bestow</L>
<L>His future, studies to reform from this</L>
<L>What in another might be judg'd amiss.</L>
<L>And yet despair not, Gentlemen; though he fear</L>
<L>His strengths to please, we hope that you shall hear</L>
<L>Some things so writ, as you may truly say</L>
<L>He hath not quite forgot to make a Play,</L>
<L>As 'tis with malice rumour'd: His intents</L>
<L>Are fair; and though he want the complements</L>
<L>Of wide-mouth'd Promisers, who still engage</L>
<L>(Before their Works are brought upon the Stage)</L>
<L>Their parasites to proclaim 'em: This last birth</L>
<L>Deliver'd without noise, may yield such mirth,</L>
<L>As ballanc'd equally, will cry down the boast</L>
<L>Of arrogance, and regain his credit lost.</L>

<L>IAm left to enquire, then to relate</L>
<L>To the still doubtful Author, at what rate</L>
<L>His marchandise are valued. If they prove</L>
<L>Staple Commodities in your Grace and love,</L>
<L>To this last birth of his <HI>Minerva,</HI> he</L>
<L>Vows, and we do believe him seriously,</L>
<L>Sloth cast of, and all pleasures else declin'd,</L>
<L>He'll search with his best care, until he finde</L>
<L>New ways, and make good in some labor'd Song,</L>
<L>Though he grow old, <HI>Apollo</HI> still is yong.</L>
<L>Cherish his good intentions, and declare</L>
<L>By any sign of favor, that you are</L>
<L>Well pleas'd, and with a general consent,</L>
<L>And he desires no more encouragement.</L>

<L>To such (and some there are, no question here,)</L>
<L>Who happy in their memories do bear</L>
<L>This Subject long since acted, and can say</L>
<L>Truly, we have seen something like this Play.</L>
<L>Our Author with becoming Modesty</L>
<L>(For in this kinde he ne'er was bold) by me,</L>
<L>In his defence, thus answers, By command</L>
<L>He undertook this task, nor could it stand</L>
<L>With his love Fortune to refuse to do;</L>
<L>What by his Patron he was call'd unto.</L>
<L>For whose delight and yours, we hope, with care</L>
<L>He hath review'd it; and with him we dare</L>
<L>Maintain to any man, that did allow</L>
<L>'T was good before, it is much better'd now;</L>
<L>Nor is it sure against the Proclamation,</L>
<L>To raise new Piles upon an old Foundation,</L>
<L>So much to them deliver'd; to the rest,</L>
<L>To whom each scene is fresh, he doth protest,</L>
<L>Should his Muse fail now a fair flight to make,</L>
<L>He cannot fancy what will please, or take.</L>
