Beare cannot finde <HI>Origanum</HI> to heale his

vs, that seeing you cannot draw from our
labours sweete content, you leaue behinde you a sowre
mislike, and with open reproach blame our good mea∣ninges:
because you cannot reap your wonted mirthes.
Our intēt was at this time to moue inward delight, not
outward lightnesse, and to breede, (if it might bee) soft
smiling, not loude laughing: knowing it to the wise to
be as great pleasure to heare counsell mixed with witte,
as to the foolish to haue sporte mingled with rudenesse.
They were banished the Theater at Athens, and from
Rome hyssed, that brought parasites on the stage with
apish actions, or fooles with vnciuill habites, or Curti∣sans
with immodest words. We haue endeuoured to be
as farre from vnseemely speaches, to make your eares
glowe, as wee hope you will bee from vnkinde reportes
to make our cheekes blush. The Griffyon neuer sprea∣deth
her wings in the sunne, when she hath any sick fea∣thers:
yet haue we ventured to present out exercise bee∣fore
your indgements, when we know them full of weak
matter, yeelding rather our selues to the curtesie, which
we haue euer sound, then to the precisenesse, which wee

free man, possessing for riches
content, and for honors quiet.
Thy thoughts are no higher thē
thy fortunes, nor thy desires
greater then thy calling. Who
climeth, standeth on glasse, and falleth on thorne. Thy
hearts thirste is satisfied with thy hands thrift, and thy
gentle labours in the day, turne to sweete slumbers in
the night. As much doth it delight thee to rule thine
oare in a calme streame, as it dooth Sapho to swaye the
Scepter in her braue court. Enuie neuer casteth her eie
lowe, ambition pointeth alwaies vpwarde, and reuenge
barketh onely at starres. Thou farest dilicately, if thou
haue a fare to buy any thing. Thine angle is ready, when
thine oar is idle, and as sweet is the fish which thou get∣test
in the ryuer, as the fowle which other buye in the
market. Thou needst not feare poyson in thy glasse, nor
treason in thy garde. The winde is thy greatest enemy,
whose might is withstoode with pollicy. O sweete life
seldom found vnder a goldē couert, oftē vnder a thach∣ed
cotage. But here commeth one, I will withdrawe my

<P>It is no lesse vnseemely then vnwholsom for
Venus, who is most honoured in Princes courtes, to so∣iourne
with Vulcan in a smithes forge, where bellowes
blow in steede of sighes, dark smokes rise for sweet per∣fumes,
&amp; for the panting of louing hearts, is only heard
the beating of steeled hāmers. Vnhappy Venus, y<SUP>t</SUP> cariing
fire in thine own breast, thou shouldest dwel with fire in
<PB REF="4"/>
his forge. What doth Vulcan all day but endeuour to be
as crabbed in maners, as he is crooked in body? driuing
nailes, when he should giue kisses, and hammering hard
armours, when he should sing sweete Amors. It came by
lot, not loue, that I was lincked with him. He giues thee
bolts, Cupid, in steed of arrowes, fearing belike (iealous
foole that he is) that if he shuld giue thee an arrow head
he should make himself a broad head. But come, we wil
to Syracusa, where thy deitie shal be shown, and my dis∣daine.
I will yoke the necke, that yet neuer bowed, at
which, if Ioue repine, Ioue shal repent. Sapho shal know,
be she neuer so faire, that there is a Venus, which can cō∣quer,
were she neuer so fortunate.</P>

<P>Here you see as great vertue, far greater braue

by nature, by birth royall, learned by education by go∣uernment
politike, rich by peace: insomuch as it is hard
to iudge, whether she be more beautifull or wise, vertu∣ous
<PB REF="5"/>
or fortunate. Beesides, doe you not looke on faire
Ladies in steede of good letters, and behold faire faces
in steed of fine phrases: In vniuersities vertues and vi∣ces
are but shadowed in colours white and blacke, in
courtes shewed to life good and bad. There, times paste
are read of in old bookes, times present set downe by
new deuises, times to come coniectured at by aime, by
prophesie, or chaunce here, are times in perfection, nor
by deuise, as fables, but in execution, as trueths. Beleeue
me Pandion, in Athens you haue but tombs, we in court
the bodies, you the pictures of Venus &amp; the wise God∣desses,
we the persons &amp; the vertues. What hath a seh ol∣ler
found out by study, that a courtier hath not found
out by practise. Simple are you that think to see more at
the candle snuffe, then the sunne beams, to saile further
in a litle brooke, then in the maine Ocean, to make a
greater haruest by gleaning, then reaping. How say you
Pandion, is not all this true?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trach.</SPEAKER>

<P>I, but this is the court of Sapho natures mi∣racle,

<P>Yet hath <HI>Salurus</HI> blasts, and water boughes,
wormes and Caterpillers.</P>
</SP>

<P>The vertue of the tree is not the cause: but the
Easterly wind, which is thought commonly to bring
cankers and rottenesse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pandi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor the excellencie of Sapho the occasion: but
the iniquitie of flatterers, who alwaies whisper in Prin∣ces
eares suspition and sowrenesse.</P>

<P>Why, then you conclude with me, that Sapho
for vertue hath no copartner.</P>

<P>Phao, thy meane fortune causeth thee to vse
an oare, and thy sodaine bewtie a glasse: by the one is
seene thy need, in the other thy pride. O <HI>Venus,</HI> in thin∣king
thou hast blest me, thou hast curst me, adding to a
poore estate, a proud heart: and to a disdained man, a
disdaining minde. Thou doest not flatter thy selfe Phao,
thou art faire: faire? I feare me faire, be a word too foule
for a face so passing fayte. But what auaileth bewtie,
hadst thou all things thou wouldest wish, thou mightst
die to morrow, and didst thou want al things thou desi∣rest,
thou shalt liue till thou diest. Tushe Phao, there is
growne more pride in thy minde, then fauour in thy
face. Blush foolish boy, to think on thine own thoughts:
cease complaints, &amp; craue counsell. And loe, behold Sy∣billa
in the mouth of her caue, I will salute her. Ladye, I
feare me I am out of my way, and so benighted withall

added great promises, I either desirous to make trial of
his power, or willing to prolong mine owne life, caught
vp my handful of sand, consenting to his suite, if I might
liue as many yeares as there were graines. <HI>Phoebus,</HI> (for
what cannot Gods doe, and what for loue will they not
do,) graunted my petition. And then I sighe and blushe

<P>I will Hauing receiued long life by Phoebus, &amp;
rare bewtie by nature, I thought all the yeere woulde
haue beene May, that fresh colours would alwaies con∣tinue,
y<SUP>t</SUP> time &amp; fortune could not weare out, what Gods
and nature had wrought vppe: not once imagining that
white and read should returne to black and yellow, the
Iuniper, the longer it grew, the crookedder it waxed, or
that in a face without blemish, there should come wrin∣kles
without number. I did as you do, go with my glasse,
rauished with the pride of mine own bewtie, &amp; you shall
do as I doe, loath to see a glasse disdaining deformitie.
There was none that heard of my fault, but shunned my
fauour, insomuch as I stooped for age before I tasted of
youth, sure to be long liued, vncerteine to bee beloued.
Gentlemen that vsde to sigh from their heartes for my
sweete loue, began to point with their fingers at my wi∣thered
face, &amp; laughed to see the eies, out of which fire
seemed to sparkle, to be suckered being old with specta∣cles.
This causeth me to withdraw my selfe to a solitary
caue, where I must leade sixe hundred yeeres in no lesse
pensiuenesse of crabbed age, then grief of remembred
youth. Only this comfort, that being ceased to be faire,
I study to be wise, wishing to be thought a graue matrō,
since I cannot returne to be a young maide.</P>

<P>What will you haue me doe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sybilla</SPEAKER>
<P>Take heede you do not as I did. Make not too
much of fading bewty, which is fair in the cradle, &amp; foul
in the graue, resembling <HI>Polyon,</HI> whose leaues are white
in the morning, and blew before night, or <HI>Anyta,</HI> which
being a sweet flower at the rising of the sunne, becom∣meth
a weede, if it be not pluckt before the setting Fair
faces haue no fruites, if they haue no witnesses. When
you shall behold ouer this tender flesh a tough skinne,
your eies which were wont to glaunce on others faces
to be suncke so hollow, that you can scarce looke out of
your own head, and when all your teech shall wagge as
faste as your tongue, thē wil you repent the time which
you cannot recall, and be enforced to beare what moste
you blame. Loose not the pleasaunt time of your youth,
then the which there is nothing swifter, nothing swee∣ter.
Bewtie is a slippery good, which decreaseth whilest
it is encreasing, resēbling the Medler, which in the mo∣ment
of his full ripenes is known to be in a rottennes.
Whiles you looke in the glasse, it waxeth old with time,
if on the Sunne parcht with heate, if on the winde, bla∣sted
with cold. A great care to keepe it, a short space to
enioy it, a sodain time to loose it. Be not coy, when you
are courted. Fortunes wings are made of times fea∣thers,
which stay not whilest one may measure them. Be
affable and curteous in youth, that you may be honou∣red
in age. Roses that lose their colours, keepe their sa∣uours,
and pluckt from the stalke, are put to the still. <HI>Co∣tonea,</HI>
<PB REF="9"/>
because it boweth when the sunne riseth, is swee∣test,
when it is oldest: and children, which in their tēder
yeeres sow curtesie, shal in their declining states reap pi∣tie.
Be not proud of bewties painting whose colours
cōsume themselues, because they are bewties painting.</P>

reach a starre: thou shalt be hated most, because thou art
loued most. Thy death shalbe feared &amp; wished: so much
for prophecie, which nothing can preuent: and this for
counsell, which thou maist follow. Keepe not companie
with Antes, that haue winges, nor talke with any, neere
the hill of a mowle, where thou smellest the sweetnesse
of serpents breath, beware thou touch no parte of the
bodie. Be not mery among those that put Buglosse in
their wine, and suger in thine. If any talke of the Eclipse
of the sunne, say thou neuer sawest it. Nourishe no co∣nies
in thy vaultes, nor swallowes in thine eues. Sowe
next thy vine <HI>Mandrage,</HI> and euer keepe thine eares o∣pen,

<P>Loue, faire child, is to be gouerned by arte, as thy
boat by an oare: for fancie, thogh it cōmeth by hazard,
is ruled by wisdome. If my preceptes may perswade,
<PB REF="13"/>
(and I pray thee let them perswade) I woulde wish thee
first to be diligent: for that womenne desire nothing
more then to haue their seruants officious. Be alwaies in
sight, but neuer slothful. Flatter I meane, lie, litle things
catch light mindes, and fancy is a worme, that feedeth
first vpon fenell. Imagine with thy selfe all are to bee
won, otherwise mine aduise were as vnnecessary as thy
labour. It is vnpossible for the brittle mettall of womē
to withstand the flattering attemptes of men: only this,
let them be asked, their sex requireth no lesse, their mo∣desties
are to be allowed so much. Be prodigall in pray∣ses
and promises, bewtie must haue a trumpet, &amp; pride
a gifte. Peacocks neuer spread their feathers, but when
they are flattered, &amp; Gods are seldome pleased, if they
be not bribed. There is none so foule, that thinketh not
her selfe faire. In commending thou canst loose no la∣bor.
for of euery one thou shalt be beleeued. O simple
women, that are brought rather to beleeue what their
eares heare of flattering men, then what their eies see in
true glasses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phao</SPEAKER>
<P>You degresse onely to make me beleeue, that
women do so lightly beleeue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sybilla</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to the purpose. Chuse such times to break
thy suite, as thy Lady is pleasant. The wooden horse en∣tred
<HI>Troy,</HI> when the soldiers were quaffyng, and <HI>Penelope</HI>
forsooth, whome fables make so coy, among the pottes
wrong her wooers by the fists, when she lowred on their
faces. Grapes are minde glasses. <HI>Venus</HI> worketh in <HI>Bac∣chus</HI>
presse, &amp; bloweth fire vpon his lycour. When thon
talkest with her, let thy speach be pleasant, but not in∣credible.
Chuse such words as may (as many may) melt
her minde. Honney ranckleth, when it is eaten for plea∣sure
and faire words wound, when they are hearde for
loue. Write, and persist in writing, they read more then
is written to them, &amp; write lesse then they thinke. In cō∣ceite
studie to be pleasaunt in attire braue, but not too
<PB REF="13"/>
curious, when she smileth laugh outright, if rise, stande
vp, if sit, lye downe. Loose al thy time to keepe time with
her. Can you sing, shew your cunning, can you daunce,
vse your legges, can you play vppō any instrument, pra∣ctise
your fingers to please her fancy, seeke out qualy∣ties.
If she seeme at the first cruell, be not discouraged. I
tell the a straung thing, womenne striue, because they
would be ouercome, force they call it: but such a wel∣come
force they account it, that continually, they study
to be enforced. To faire words ioyne sweet kisses, which
if they gently receiue, I say no more, they wil gently re∣ceiue.
But be not pinned alwaies on her sleeues, straun∣gers
haue greene rushes, whē daily guests are not worth
a rushe. Looke pale, and learne to be leane, that who so
seeth thee, may say, the Gentleman is in loue. Vse no
forcerie to hasten thy successe, wit is a witch, <HI>Vlysses</HI> was
not faire, but wise, not cunning in charmes, but sweete
in speach, whose filed tōgue made those inamoured that
sought to haue him inchaūted. Be not coy, beare, sooth,
sweare, die to please thy Lady, these are rules for poore
louers, to others I am no mistresse. He hath wit ynough,
that can giue ynough. Dumbe men are eloquent, if they
be liberall. Beleeue me great gifts are little Gods. When
thy mistresse doth bend her brow, do not thou bend thy
fiste. Camokes must be bowed with sleight, not strēgth,
water to be trained with pipes, not stopped with sluses,
fire to be quenched with dust, not with swordes. If thou
haue a ryuall, be pacient, arte muste winde him out not
malice: time, not might, her chaunge, and thy constan∣cie.
Whatsoeuer she weareth: sweare it becomes her. In
thy louce be secrete. <HI>Venus</HI> cofers, though they bee hol∣low,
neuer sound, &amp; when they seeme emptiest, they are
fullest. Old foole that I am, to doe thee good, I beginne
to doate, &amp; counsell that, which I woulde haue concea∣led.
Thus Phao haue I giuen thee certeine regardes, no
rules, only to set thee in the way, not to bring thee hōe.</P>

<P>Ah impacient disease of loue, and Goddesse
of loue thrise vnpitifull. The Eagle is neuer stricken with
thunder, nor the Olyue with lightning and maye great
Ladies be plagued with loue? O <HI>Venus,</HI> haue I not stra∣wed
thine Altars with sweete roses? kepte thy swannes
in cleare rvuers? sead thy sparrowes with ripe corne, &amp;
harboured thy doues in faire houses? Thy Tortoys haue
I nourished vnder my fig tree, my chāber haue I ceeled
with thy Cockleshels, &amp; dipped thy spung into the fre∣shest
waters. Didst thou nourse me in my swadling clouts
with wholsome hearbes, that I might perish in my flow∣ting
yeares by fancie? I perceiue, but to late I perceiue,
and yet not too late, because at last, that straines are
caught aswell by stooping too low, as reaching to high:
that eies are bleared as soone with vapours that come
from the earth, as with beames that procede from the
sunne. Loue lodgeth sometimes in caues: &amp; thou Phoe∣bus,
that in the pride of thy hearre shinest all day in our
Horizon, at night dippest thy head in the Ocean. Re∣siste

it Sapho, whilest it is yet tender. Of Acornes comes
Oakes, of droppes floudes, of sparkes flames of Atomies
Elementes. But alas it fareth with mee as with waspes,
who feeding on serpents, make their stings more veno∣mous:
for glutting my selfe on the face of Phao, I haue
made my desire more desperate. Into the neast of an
<HI>Alcyon</HI> no birde can enter but the <HI>Alcyon,</HI> and into the
hart of so great a Ladie can any creep but a great Lord?
There is an hearbe (not vnlike vnto my loue) whiche the
further it groweth from the sea, the salter it is, and my
desires the more they swarue from reason, the more
seeme they reasonable. When Phao commeth, what thē?
wilt thou open thy loue? Yea. No Sapho: but staring in
his face till thine eies dasell, and thy spirites fainte, die
before his face: then this shall be written on thy Tomb,
that though thy loue were greater then wisdome could
endure; yet thine honour was such, as loue could not vi∣olate,

And when I noursed thee Sapho with lettice, woulde it

his neast in a tall Caedar, where, whiles with his bill hee
was framing his buylding, he lost as many fethers from
his wings, as he laid strawes in his neast: yet scambling
to catch hold to harbor in the house he had made, he so
denly fell from the bough where he stoode. And thē pi∣tifully
casting vp his eies, he cried in such tearmes (as I
imagined) as might either cōdemne the nature of such
a tree, or the daring of such a minde. Whilest he lay qua∣king
vpō the ground, &amp; I gazing one the Caeder, I might
perceiue Antes to breede in the rinde coueting only to

<SPEAKER>Venus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come Cupid, receiue with thy fathers instru∣ments,
thy mothers instructions: for thou must be wise
in conceite, if thou wilt be fortunate in execution. This
arrow is feathered with the winges of <HI>Aegitus,</HI> which ne∣uer
sleepeth for feare of his hen: the heade toucht with
the stone <HI>Perillus,</HI> which causeth mistruste and ielousie.
Shoote this, Cupid, at men that haue faire wiues, which
will make them rubbe the browes, when they swell in
the braines. This shaft is headed with <HI>Lidian</HI> steel, which
striketh a deepe disdain of y<SUP>t</SUP> which we most desire, y<SUP>e</SUP> fea∣thers
are of <HI>Turtel,</HI> but dipped in the bloud of a <HI>Tigresse,</HI>
draw this vp close to the head at Sapho, that she may de∣spise,
where now she doates. Good my boye, gall her on
the side, that for Phaos loue she may neuer sighe. This
arrow is feathered with the <HI>Phoenix</HI> winge, and headed
with the Eagles bill, it maketh mē passionate in desires,
in loue constant, and wise in conueiaunce, melting as it
were their fancies into faith: this arrowe, sweete childe,
and with as great ayme as thou canst, must Phao be stri∣ken
withall, and cry softly to thy selfe in the very loose,
Venus. Sweete Cupid mistake me not, I wil make a quiuer
for that by it selfe. The fourth hath feathers of the Pea∣cocke,
but glewed with the gum of the <HI>Mirtle</HI> tree, hea∣ded
with fine golde, and fastened with brittle <HI>Chrysocoll:</HI>
this shoote at daintie and coy Ladies, at amiable and
young Nymphes, chuse no other white but women: for
this will worke lyking in their mindes, but not loue af∣fabilitie
in speach, but no faith, courtly fauours, to bee
<PB REF="23"/>
Mistresses ouer many, but constant to none: sighes to be
fetcht from the longes, not the heart, and teares to bee
wronge out with their fingers, not their eies, secrete
laughing at mens pale lookes and neate attire, open re∣ioycinge
at their owne comlinesse and mens courtinge.
Shoote this arrowe among the thickest of them, whose
bosomes lye open, because they woulde be striken with
it. And seeing men tearme women <HI>Iupiters</HI> fooles, wo∣men
shall make men <HI>Venus</HI> fooles. This shafte is leade in
the head, and whose feathers are of the night Rauen, a
deadly and poysoned shafte, which breedeth hate onely
against those which sue for loue. Take heede Cupid thou
hitte not Phao with this shafte: for then shall Venus pe∣rishe.
This laste is an old arrow, but newlye mended, the
arrow which hitte both Sapho and Phao, working onely
in meane mindes an aspiring to superiours, &amp; in high
estates a stooping to inferiours: with this Cupid I am
galled my selfe, till thou haue galled Phao with the o∣ther.</P>

<P>Goe, loyter not, nor mistake your shafte. Now
Venus, hast thou plaide a cunning parte, though not cur∣raunt.
But why should Venus dispute of vnlawfulnesse in
loue, or faith in affection? beeing both the Goddesse of
loue and affection? knowing there is as litle trueth to
be vsed in loue, as there is reason. No, sweete Phao, Ve∣nus
will obtaine because she is venus. Not thou Ioue
with thūder in thy hand, shalt take him out of my hands.
I haue new arrowes now for my boy, and fresh flames, at
which the Gods shall tremble, if they beginne to trou∣ble
me. But I will expect the euent, and tarye for Cupid
at the forge▪</P>
