<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LL's gone! still thou'rt a Gentleman, that's all; but a poore one, that's nothing: What Milke brings thy Meadowes forth now? where are thy goodly Vp-lands and thy Downe-lands, all sunck into that little pitte Lecherie? why should a Gallant pay but two shillings for his Ordnary that nourishes him, and twenty times two for his Brothell that consumes him? but where's Long-acre? in my Vncles conscience, which is 3. yeares voyage about; he that setts out vpon his conscience, nere finds the way home againe, he is either swallowed in the quick-sands of Law-quillits, or splits vpō the Piles of a Praemunire; yet these old Foxe-braind—and oxe-browde Vncles, haue still defences for their Auarice, and Apologies for their practises, and will thus greete our follyes.</P>

<L>Hee that doth his youth expose,</L>
<L>To Brothell, drinke, and danger,</L>
<L>Let him that is his neerest Kinne,</L>
<L>Cheate him before a stranger.</L>
</LG>
<P>And that's his Vncle, 'tis a principle in Vsury; I dare not visit the Cittie, there I should bee too soone visited, by that horri∣ble plague my Debts, and by that meanes I loose a Virgins loue, her portion and her Vertues, well, how should a man liue now, that ha's no liuing; hum? why are there not a million of men in the world, that onely soiourne vpon their braine, and make their wittes their Mercers; and am I but one amongst that Million and cannot thriue vpon't; any Trick out of the compasse of Lawe now, would come happily to me.</P>

<P>Why then all's furnisht; I shall goe nigh to catch that olde Foxe mine Vncle, tho hee make but some amends for my vndooing, yet there's some comfort in't — hee cannot other∣wise choose (tho it bee but in hope to coozen mee agen) but supply any hastie want that I bring to towne with mee, the De∣uice well and cunningly carryed, the name of a riche Widdow, and foure hundred a yeare in good earth, will so coniure vp a kinde of Vsurers loue in him to mee, that hee will not onely desire my presence, which at first shall scarce bee granted him, Ile keepe off a purpose, but I shall finde him so officious to de∣serue, so ready to supply, I know the state of an old mans af∣fection so well, if his Nephew bee poore indeed, why hee letts God alone with him, but if hee be once rich, then heele bee the first man that helpes him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Tis right the world, for in these dayes an olde mans loue to his kindred, is like his kindnesse to his wife, 'tis alwayes done before hee comes at it.</P>

<L>You have heard all truth, his Vncle and my Brother, haue beene these three yeares mortall Aduersaries. Two old tough spirits, they seldome meete but fight, or quarrell when tis calmest;</L>

<P>What was the quarrell sir?</P>
</SP>

<P>And was this all sir:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was e'en it sir, yet for all this I know no reason but the match might go forward betwixt his wiues Sonne and my Neece, what tho there bee a dissention betweene the two olde men, I see no reason it should put a difference betweene the two yonger, tis as naturall for old folkes to fall out, as for yong to fall in? A scholler comes a wooing to my Neece, well, hee's wise, but he's poore, her Sonne comes a wooing to my Neece, well, hees a foole, but hees rich —</P>

<P>Nay thats not all neither, prethee take truce with thy ioy, and listen to mee, thou know'st I haue a wealthy Vncle i'th Citty, some-what the wealthier by my follyes; the report of this fortune well and cunningly carried, might be a meanes to drawe some goodnesse from the Vsuring Rascall, for I haue put her in hope already of some estate that I haue eyther in land or money: now if I be found true in neither, what may I expect but a suddaine breach of our loue, vtter dissolution of the match, and confusion of my fortunes for euer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Host.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wilt thou but trust the managing of thy businesse with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Witt.</SPEAKER>
<P>With thee? why will I desire to thriue in my purpose? will I hugge foure hundred a yeare? I that know the misery of nothing? will that man wish a riche widdow, that has nere a hole to put his head in? with thee mine Hoste, why beleeue it, sooner with thee then with a Couy of Counsellors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Host.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanke you for your good report yfaith sir, and if I stand you not insteed, why then let an Hoste come off <HI>Hic &amp; haec hostis,</HI> a deadly enemie to Dice, Drinke, and Venery; come where's this widdow?</P>
