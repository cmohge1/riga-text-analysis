<L>T'had been another case; then cast she up</L>
<L>Her pretty eye, and wink't; the word me thought was then</L>
<L>Come not till twitter light: Next, thus her fingers went,</L>
<L>As who should say, I'd fain have a hole broke to 'scape away.</L>
<L>Then look'd upon her watch, and twice she nodded,</L>

Yet the proud scornful Ape, when all the lodgings were taken up with strangers th'other night, he would not suffer me to come to Bed to him, but kickt and prickt, and pinch'd me, like an Urchin; there's no good quality in him. Oh my Conscience▪ I think he scarce knows how to stride a Horse; I saw him with a little hunting Nag, but thus high t'other day, and he
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
was fain to lead him to a high rail, and get up like a Butter-wench; there's no good Fellowship in this Dandiprat, this Dive-dapper, as is in other Pages; they'd go a swimming with no familiarly i'th' heat of Summer, and clap what you call 'ems: But I could ne∣ver get that little Monkey yet to put off his Breeches.

<P>Nay sure I'll be quite out of the precincts of a Fool, if I live but two days to an end: I will turn Gipsey presently, and that's the high-way to the dantiest knave that ever Mothers Son took journey too. Oh those dear Gipseys, they live the merriest lives, eat sweet stoln Hens, pluckt over Pales or Hedges by a twitch; they are nev'r without a plump and lovely Goose, or beautiful Sow-pig; those things I saw with mine own eyes to day; they call those vanities, and triffing pilfries: But if a privy search were made amongst 'em, they should finde other manner of ware about 'em; Cups, Rings, and Silver Spoons, by'r Lady, Bracelets, Pearl Neck-laces, and Chains of Gold sometimes; they are the wittiest theeves: I'll stay no longer, but ev'n go look what I can steal, now presently, and so begin to bring my self ac∣quainted with 'em.</P>

<L>Often with womans frailty, and her blood,</L>
<L>Nor publick sight, the lightning of temptations,</L>
<L>Which from the eye strikes sparks into the bosom,</L>
<L>And sets whole hearts on fire, hath power to raise</L>
<L>A heat in her 'bove that which feeds chaste life,</L>
<L>And gives that cherishing means; she's the same still,</L>
<L>And seems so seriously imploy'd in soul,</L>
<L>As if she could not tend to cast an eye</L>
<L>Upon deserts so low as those in man.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="24"/>It merits famous memory I confess;</L>

<L>All by the rashness of one vow made desperate,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Card.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>True, there your Lordship spake enough in little;</L>
<L>There's nothing to be hoped for but repulses;</L>
<L>She's not to seek for armor against love,</L>
<L>That has bid battel to his powers so long;</L>
<L>He that should try her now, had need come strong,</L>
<L>And with more force then his own Arguments,</L>

<L>That Soldier's tough, has been in seven <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ars fight,</L>
<L>Her vow's invincible; for you must grant this,</L>
<L>If those desires train'd up in flesh and blood</L>
<L>To war continually 'gainst good intents,</L>
<L>Prove all too weak for her, having advantage</L>
<L>Both of her sex, and her unskilfulness</L>
<L>At a Spiritual weapon, wanting knowledge</L>
<L>To manage resolution, and yet win;</L>
<L>What force can a poor Argument bring in?</L>
<L>The Books that I have publish'd in her praise,</L>
<L>Commend her constancy, and that's Fame-worthy;</L>
<L>But if you read me o'r with eyes of enemies,</L>
<L>You cannot justly, and with honor tax me,</L>
<L>That I disswade her life from marriage there:</L>
<L>Now Heaven, and fruitfulness forbid, not I:</L>
<L>She may be constant there, and the hard war</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="25"/>Of Chastity, is held a vertuous strife,</L>
<L>As rare in marriage, as in single life;</L>
<L>Nay, by some writers rarer: hear their reasons,</L>
<L>And you'll approve 'em fairly. She that's single,</L>
<L>Either in Maid or Widow, oftentimes</L>
<L>The fear of shame, more then the fear of Heaven,</L>
<L>Keeps chaste, and constant; when the tempest comes</L>
<L>She knows she has no shelter for her sin,</L>
<L>It must endure the weathers of all censure:</L>
<L>Nothing but Sea and Air, that poor Bark feels,</L>
<L>When she in wedlock is like a safe vessel</L>
<L>That lies at anchor; come what weathers can,</L>
<L>She has her Harbor: At her great unlading▪</L>
<L>Much may be stoln, and little waste; the Master</L>
<L>Thinks himself rich enough with what he has,</L>
<L>And holds content by that. How think you now Lords▪</L>

<L>Speak low sweet Mother; you are able to spoil as many</L>
<L>As come within the hearing: If it be not</L>
<L>Your fortune to mar all, I have much marvel.</L>
<L>I pray do not you teach her to rebel,</L>
<L>When she's in a good way to obedience,</L>
<L>To rise with other women in commotion</L>
<L>Against their husbands, for six Gowns a year,</L>
<L>And so maintain their cause, when they'r once up,</L>
<L>In all things else that require cost enough.</L>
<L>They are all of 'em a kinde of spirits soon rais'd,</L>
<L>But not so soon laid (Mother) As for example,</L>
<L>A womans belly is got up in a trice,</L>
<L>A simple charge ere it be laid down again:</L>
<L>So ever in all their quarrels, and their courses,</L>
<L>And I'm a proud man, I hear nothing of 'em,</L>
<L>They'r very still, I thank my happiness,</L>
<L>And sound asleep; pray let not your tongue wake 'em.</L>
<L>If you can but rest quiet, she's contented</L>
<L>With all conditions, that my fortunes bring her to;</L>
<L>To keep close as a wise that loves her husband;</L>
<L>To go after the rate of my ability,</L>
<L>Not the licentious swindg of her own will,</L>
<L>Like some of her old school-fellows, she intends</L>
<L>To take out other works in a new Sampler,</L>
<L>And frame the fashion of an honest love,</L>
<L>Which knows no wants; but mocking poverty</L>
<L>Brings forth more children, to make rich men wonder</L>
<L>At divine Providence, that feeds mouths of Infants,</L>
<L>And sends them none to feed, but stuffs their rooms</L>
<L>With fruitful bags, their beds with barren wombs.</L>
<L>Good Mother, make not you things worse then they are,</L>
<L>Out of your too much openness; pray take heed on't;</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="49"/>Nor imitate the envy of old people,</L>
<L>That strive to mar good sport, because they are per∣fit.</L>

<L>I'll prove an excellent husband, here's my hand,</L>

<L>Which were enough after the rate of minde,</L>
<L>To erect Temples for content plac'd here;</L>
<L>I have forsook Friends, Fortunes, and my Country,</L>

<L>And few is the good number; thy successes</L>

<L>Yet they must all be welcome, and us'd well.</L>
<L>I'll call this place the place of my birth now,</L>

<L>Sir, I have read you over all this while</L>

<L>There is no vertue can be sooner miss'd,</L>

<L>And sets 'em all in order; Heaven and Angels</L>
<L>Take great delight in a converted sinner.</L>
<L>Why should you then a Servant and Professor,</L>
<L>Differ so much from them? If ev'ry woman</L>
