<P>TOo soone and too late, this work is published: Too soone, in that it was in the Presse, before <HI>J</HI> had notice of it, by which meanes some faults may escape in the Printing. Too late, for that it was not published when the general voice of the people had seald it for good, and the newnesse of it made it much more desired, then at this time: For Plaies in this Citie are like wenches new falne to the trade, onelie desired of your neatest gallants, whiles the' are fresh: when they grow stale they must be vented by Termers and Cuntrie chapmen. I know not how this labor will please, Sure <HI>J</HI> am it past the censure of the Stage with a generall applause, now (whether <HI>vox populi</HI> be <HI>vox dei</HI> or no) that <HI>I</HI> leaue to be tried by the accute iudgement of the famous six wits of the Citie: Farewell.</P>

VVell ile home now, and bring the true word next time: I shall expect my wife anon red hot with zeale, and big with melting teares; and this night do I expect, (as her manner is) she will weepe me a whole Chamberpot full, <HI>Loquor Lapides</HI>? do J cast pills abroad? tis no matter what I
