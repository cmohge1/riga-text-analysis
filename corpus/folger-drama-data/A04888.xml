<L><HI>DVnston,</HI> how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighlie are we bound to praise</L>
<L>The Eternall God that still prouides for vs,</L>
<L>And giues vs leaue to rule in this our land,</L>
<L>Lyke wise <HI>Vaspasian, Romes</HI> rich Emperour:</L>
<L>Suppressing sinue, that daylie raignes in vs?</L>
<L>First, murther we rewarde with present death,</L>
<L>And those that doe commit fellonious crimes,</L>

<L>Must lykewise suffer death by lawes decree,</L>
<L>And that decree is trreuocable.</L>
<L>Then as I am Gods Uicegerent here on earth,</L>
<L>By Gods appointment heere to raigne and rule,</L>
<L>So must I seeke to cut abuses downe,</L>
<L>That lyke to <HI>Hydras</HI> heades, daylie growes vp one in ano∣thers place,</L>
<L>And therein makes the land infectious,</L>
<L>Which if with good regard we looke not to,</L>
<L>We shall, lyke <HI>Sodom,</HI> feele that fierie doome,</L>
<L>That God in Iustice did inflict on them.</L>

<SPEAKER>Dunston.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Graces care herein I much cummend,</L>
<L>And <HI>England</HI> hath iust cause to praise the Lorde,</L>
<L>That sent so good a King to gouerne them,</L>
<L>Your lyfe may be a Lanterne to the state,</L>
<L>By perfect signe of humilitie.</L>
<L>Howe blest had <HI>Sodome</HI> bene in sight of God,</L>
<L>If they had had so kinde a Gouernour,</L>
<L>They had then vndoubtedlie e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>capt that doome,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>That God in iustice did inflict on them:</L>
<L>Then <HI>England</HI> kneele vpon thy hartie knee,</L>
<L>And praise that God, that so prouides for thee.</L>
<L>And vertuous Prince, thou <HI>Salomon</HI> of our age,</L>
<L>Whose yeares I hope shall double <HI>Nestors</HI> raigne,</L>
<L>And bring a thousand profits to the land:</L>
<L>My selfe (dread Prince) in token of my loue,</L>
<L>And dutifull obedience to your Grace,</L>
<L>Will studie daylie, as my dutie willes,</L>
<L>To roote sinnes from the flourishing common wealth.</L>
<L>That <HI>Fame</HI> in euery angle of the world,</L>
<L>May sound due praise of <HI>Englands</HI> vetuous King.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Dunston.</HI> liue thou, and counsell still the king,</L>
<L>To maintaine Iustice, were it on himself,</L>
<L>Rather than soothing him in his abuse,</L>
<L>To see subuersion of his common wealth.</L>
<L>I tell thee <HI>Dunston,</HI> thou hast pleased the King,</L>
<L>And prooued thy selfe a vertuous counsellour:</L>
<L>Thy counsell is to me as North stars light,</L>
<L>That guides the Sayler to his wished port:</L>
<L>For by that starre he is so comforted,</L>
<L>That he sailes daungerlesse on daungerous seas,</L>
<L>And in his deepest sadnes comforts him:</L>
<L>So <HI>Dunstons</HI> knowledge is that starre of ioy,</L>
<L>That will with helpe conduct me to my happinesse.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honesty.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet thou art not happy <HI>Edgar,</HI></L>
<L>Because that sinnes, lyke swarmes, remaine in thee.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, tis impossible, for I haue studied still,</L>
<L>To root abuses from the common wealth,</L>
<L>That may infect the king or communaltie.</L>
<L>Therefore, base Peasant, wilfull as thou art,</L>
<L>I tell thee troth, thou hast displeasd the King.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honesty.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, the King hath displeased himselfe,</L>
<L>In trusting euery one that speaks him faire:</L>
<L>For through faire words, Kings manie tymes are faine</L>
<L>To countenance Knaues by their authoritie:</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>I will not say your Grace doeth so.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Perin.</SPEAKER>
<L>No sir, you were not best.</L>
</SP>

<L>Why, if I should, I might make good my wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L>And fynd a Knaue, I feare, before I part.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, what art thou?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honesty.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mary I goe plaine, and my name is <HI>Honesty,</HI></L>
<L>A friend to your Grace, but a foe to Flatterers,</L>
<L>And one that hath a <HI>Knacke to know a Knaue.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Perin.</SPEAKER>
<L>As how sir, by art, or by some foolish gift God hath giuen you,</L>
<L>You are some Uissitian, or skild in Uisognomy, or in palmes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</L>
<L>For I am sure, you can neuer do it by Astronomie,</L>
<L>Because there are no starres to knowe a knaue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<L>True, but many an honest man knowes a knaue to his cost,</L>
<L>And is neither Uisitiā, Uisognomer, palmester, nor astronomer</L>
<L>But a plaine man of the country, lyke me.</L>
<L>That knowes a knaue, if he doe but see his cap.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<L>That wer pretie I faith, to see <HI>Honesty</HI> know a knaue by his cap,</L>
<L>Tis more than I can do with al the skil I haue:</L>
<L>But tel me I pray thee, how I should know a knaue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<L>I beleeue you wel, for offenders neuer bewray their offences</L>
<L>Til the Law fynd them, and punish them:</L>
<L>But you would faine tell how to know a knaue,</L>
<L>Then thus, the first man you meet in the morning,</L>
<L>If he salute you, drawe neere him,</L>
<L>And smell to his hat, and after smell to your owne,</L>
<L>And my cap to a noble, if his smel lyke yours, he is a knaue,</L>
<L>I thinke I spoke with you now.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Perin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Base Uillain, were it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Kinges presence
doth priuilege thy presūptiō, I wold teach you to iest with your fellows▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ki.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forbear, <HI>honesty,</HI> thou art a good plain fellow,</L>
<L>And I cōmend thy wit, that hast such waies to know a knaue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Honesty</HI> is plaine my Lord, but no good fellow,</L>
<L>For good fellowes be purse-takers now a daies:</L>
<L>And there be so manie of such good f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wes,</L>
<L>That <HI>Honesty</HI> may walke the stre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes without company,</L>
<L>Not that there wants company, but honest company I mean,</L>
<L>And yet <HI>Honesty▪</HI> can clap a knaue on the shoulder for al his
brauerie.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>Perin,</SPEAKER>
<L>Why (base companion) meane you me?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honesty.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not base (sir) because I was truelie begotten,</L>
<L>For Honesty may be suspected, but neuer detected:</L>
<L>But you think I had a bayliefe to my father as you had,</L>
<L>And that my mother could returne a writ of error,</L>
<L>As yours did, when such a Gallant as you were gotten.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Beleeue me, <HI>Perin,</HI> he hath toucht you now,</L>
<L>And I perceiue, though <HI>Honesty</HI> be simple,</L>
<L>Yet manie tymes he speakes trueth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honesty.</SPEAKER>
<L>True, if it please your Grace, for honest men wil not lie:</L>
<L>But if your Grace vouchsafe to giue me leaue,</L>
<L>You shall see me finde more knaues than one.</L>
<L>If my cunning faile me not, or els say <HI>Honesty</HI> had no honesty</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ki.</SPEAKER>
<L>But tel me, <HI>Dunston,</HI> how thinkest thou of this motion?</L>
<L>Were it not good thinkest thou we gaue him leaue</L>
<L>To stifle such Catterpillers as corrupt the common welth:</L>
<L>For manie tymes such simple men as he,</L>
<L>Bewray much matter in simplicitie:</L>
<L>Then tell me <HI>Dunston,</HI> what thinkest thou of his motion?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dunst.</SPEAKER>
<L>If it please your Grace to thinke it good,</L>
<L><HI>Dunston</HI> will say as once <HI>Hefestion</HI> did,</L>
<L>When <HI>Alexander</HI> wan rich <HI>Macedone,</HI></L>
<L>That what so ere the King himselfe thought meete,</L>
<L>He would in dutifull obedience yeeld vnto:</L>
<L>And so saith <HI>Dunston</HI> to your Maiestie.</L>
<L>For many times such simple men bring that to passe▪</L>
<L>That wiser heads cannot attaine vnto,</L>
<L>For doubtlesse he hath some deuice in hand,</L>
<L>Whereby to fynde such subtle knauerie.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, <HI>Dunston,</HI> then as thou hast counseld me,</L>
<L>I will for once make proofe of <HI>Honesty:</HI> sirra, come hither,</L>
<L>In hope you wil, as your profession is,</L>
<L>In honest sort to fynde deceiuers out:</L>

<L>That we may punish them for their amisse:</L>
<L>We giue thee leane to work what means thou maist,</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>So it be not preiudice to the state nor vs.</L>

<L>My gratious Lord, if <HI>Honestie</HI> offend,</L>
<L>In anie thing that he hath promised,</L>
<L>And doe not as your Grace hath giuen in charge,</L>
<L>Stifle such Caterpillers as corrupt the state.</L>
<L>Let <HI>Honestie</HI> receiue such punishment,</L>

<L>Lord, how they came in flocks to visit me,</L>
<L>The shepheard with his hooke, and Thrasher with his flaile,</L>
<L>The very pedler with his dog, and the tinker with his male.</L>
<L>Then comes a souldier counterfeit, &amp; with him was his Iug,</L>

<L>He swore that in the Kings defence, he lost his arm by chance,</L>
<L>And yet in conscience, if I were put to sweare,</L>
<L>I would be bound to lay a pouud, the knaue was neuer there,</L>
<L>And hapning mongst this companie by chance one day,</L>
<L>I had no sooner namde my name, but they ran all away,</L>

<L>Giue eare, and heare what rules I set you downe,</L>
<L>And first to thee my sonne, that liuest by wit,</L>
<L>I know thou hast so many honest sleights,</L>
<L>To shift and cosen smoothly on thy wit,</L>
<L>To cog and lie, and braue it with the best,</L>
<L>That twere but labour lost to counsell thee,</L>
<L>And therfore to the next, <HI>Walter,</HI> that seemes in shew a husband∣man:</L>
<L>My sonne, when that thy master trusts thee most,</L>
<L>And thinks thou dealest as truelie as himselfe,</L>
<L>Be thou the first to worke deceit to him:</L>
<L>So by that means thou maist inrich thy selfe,</L>
<L>And liue at pleasure when thy maister's dead:</L>
<L>And when to market thou art sent with woll,</L>
<L>Put sand amongst it, and twill make it weigh,</L>
<L>The waight twise double that it did before,</L>

<L>Then (father) thus liue I that vse me wit,</L>

<L>For when I am driuen to shift for meat or coine,</L>

<L>Then doe I flaunt it out about the change,</L>

<L>And may her dayes of blesse neuer haue end,</L>
<L>Upon whose lyfe so many lyues depend.</L>
