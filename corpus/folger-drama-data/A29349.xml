<L>BEfore I speake, me thinkes, I heare some say,</L>
<L>What can there be, to furnish out a Play,</L>
<L>In such a Home-spun Title?—In a Plaine</L>
<L>Poore Countrey Girle? Such, yeilds no lofty straine;</L>
<L>No sinewie stuffe, extracted from a Myne▪</L>
<L>Of deep, and Abstruse reading; no strong line,</L>
<L>No such a straine, and this poore Title, suite</L>
<L>Like old <HI>Pan</HI>'s Bagpipe, and <HI>Apollo's</HI> Lute.</L>
<L>What must we looke for then? A desperate wit?</L>
<L>Scoenes, full of veins, where, without a Hit</L>
<L>No man escapes, comes neere it? This indeed</L>
<L>Were to some purpose; and the way to speed.</L>
<L>But this too's from this Title.—None of these?</L>
<L>Alas poore Girle, where's then, thy hope to please?</L>
<L>What can she sing? and, like the Northerne Lasse▪</L>
<L>(That brave blithe Girle) hope to procure a passe?</L>
<L>Or, can she fight?—If so so stout, so bold</L>
<L>A brave Virago, like the Girle, worth Gold.</L>
<L>Or is shee one; that once a Countrey Maide,</L>
<L>Crack'd in the carriage, is come to Trade,</L>
<L>And set up some new Leaguer? Or suppose</L>
<L>Our Girle, a vertuous Copy, and so close</L>
<L>This inquisition of her,—Shee is—what?</L>
<L>Her owne presentment, best can tell you that,</L>
<L>Which be but pleas'd to grace, with love and favour,</L>
<L>You make the poore Girle rich, and Crowne our labour.</L>
