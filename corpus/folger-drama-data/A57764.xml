<L>COme, Wench; why here's a business soon dispatch'd.</L>
<L>Thy heart I know is now at ease: thou needst not</L>
<L>Fear what the tattling Gossips in their cups</L>
<L>Can speak against thy fame: thy childe shall know</L>
<L>Who to call <HI>Dad</HI> now.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Win.</SPEAKER>
<L>You have discharg'd the true part of an honest man;</L>
<L>I cannot request a fuller satisfaction</L>
<L>Then you have freely granted: yet methinks</L>
<L>'Tis an hard case, being lawful man and wife,</L>
<L>We should not live together.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<L>Had I fail'd</L>
<L>In promise of my truth to thee, we must</L>
<L>Have then been ever sundred; now the longest</L>
<L>Of our forbearing eithers company,</L>
<L>Is onely but to gain a little time</L>
<L>For our continuing thrift, that so hereafter</L>
<L>The Heir that shall be born may not have cause</L>
<L>To curse his hour of birth, which made him feel</L>
<L>The misery of beggery and want;</L>
<L>Two Devils that are occasions to enforce</L>
<L>A shameful end. My plots aim but to keep</L>
<L>My father's love.</L>
</SP>

<L>And that will be as difficult</L>
<L>To be preserv'd, when he shall understand</L>

<L>Should you confess it to him.</L>

<L>Fathers are</L>

Such dutiful and ready means, that ere</L>
<L>He can have notice of what's past, th' inheritance</L>

<L>I, I, in case</L>

<L>And yet, if not for my sake, have some pity</L>
<L>Upon the childe I go with, that's your own.</L>

<L>To quit which fear at once,</L>

<P>Alone? then must I tell thee in plain terms, thou hast wrong'd thy Master's house basely and lewdly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your house, Sir?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Art.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, Sir, if the nimble devil</L>
<L>That wanton'd in your blood, rebell'd against</L>
<L>All rules of honest duty. You might, Sir,</L>
<L>Have found out some more fitting place then here,</L>
<L>To have built a Stewes in. All the Country whispers</L>
<L>How shamefully thou hast undone a Maid,</L>
<L>Approv'd for modest life, for civil carriage,</L>
<L>Till thy prevailing perjuries entic'd her</L>
<L>To forfeit shame. Will you be honest yet?</L>
<L>Make her amends and marry her?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<L>So, Sir,</L>
<L>I might bring both my self and her to beggery;</L>
<L>And that would be a shame worse then the other.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Art.</SPEAKER>
<L>You should have thought on this before, and then</L>
<L>Your reason would have oversway'd the passion</L>
<L>Of your unruly lust. But that you may</L>
<L>Be left without excuse, to salve the infamy</L>
<L>Of my disgraced house, and 'cause you are</L>
<L>A Gentleman, and both of you my servants,</L>
<L>I'll make the Maid a portion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<L>So you promis'd me</L>
<L>Before, in case I married her. I know</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Arthur Clarington</HI> deserves the credit</L>
<L>Report hath lent him; and presume you are</L>
<L>A Debtor to your promise: but upon</L>
<L>What certainty shall I resolve? Excuse me</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
For being somewhat rude.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Art.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis but reason.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<L>Though my poor fortunes</L>
<L>Might happily prefer me to a choice</L>
<L>Of a far greater portion; yet to right</L>
<L>A wronged Maid, and to preserve your favour,</L>
<L>I am content to accept your proffer.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<L>And more then so, I have promis'd her</L>

<L>As for the money,</L>

<L>I'll thus much tell thee: Thou never art so distant</L>

<L>Thou never telst a lie, but that a Devil</L>

<L>Are ever haunted; but when they come to act,</L>
<L>As thy Tongue slaundering, bearing false witness.</L>
<L>Thy hand stabbing, stealing, cozening, cheating,</L>
<L>He's then within thee: thou play'st, he bets upon thy part;</L>

<P>You could do, <HI>Tom,</HI> but you must play fair, you should be stav'd off else: or if your stomach did better like to serve in some Noble Mans, Knights or Gentlemans Kitchin, if you could brook the wheel, and turn the spit, your labour could not be much; when they have Rost-meat, that's but once or twice in the week at most, here you might lick you own Toes very well: Or if you could translate your self into a Ladies Arming-puppy, there you might lick sweet lips, and do many pretty Offices; but to creep un∣der an old VVitches Coats, and suck like a great Puppy, Fie upon't!
