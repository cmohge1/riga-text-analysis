<L>In seeing men act vice then vertue fain;</L>
<L>And he less tempts a danger that delights</L>
<L>In profest players then close Hypocrites,</L>
<L>Can there no favour to the scaene be shown</L>
<L>Because <HI>Jack Fletcher</HI> was a Bishops son,</L>
<L>Or since that order is condemn'd doe you</L>
<L>Think poets therefore Antichristian too;</L>
<L>Is it unlawfull since the stage is down</L>

<L>And though in this ill treated Scene of sense,</L>
<L>The general learning is but in pretence;</L>
<L>Or else infus'd like th' Eastern Prophet's Dove,</L>
<L>To whisper us, Religion, Honour, Love;</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
Yet the more Generous race of men revives</L>
<L>This Lamp of Knowledge, and like Primitives</L>
<L>In Caves, fearless of Martyrdom, rehearse</L>
<L>The almost breathless, now, Dramatick verse.</L>
<L>How in the next age will our Youth lament</L>
<L>The loss of wit, condem'd to banishment.</L>
<L>Wit that the duller rout despise, cause they</L>
<L>Miss it in what their Zealous Priests display:</L>
<L>For Priests in melancholy Zeal admit</L>
<L>Onely a grave formality for wit;</L>
<L>And would have those that govern us comply</L>
<L>And cherish their fallacious tyranny.</L>
<L>But wherein States can no advantage gain,</L>
<L>They harmless mirth improperly restrain;</L>
<L>Since men cannot be naturally call'd free,</L>
<L>If Rulers claim more then securitie.</L>
<L>How happens then this rigour o're the Stage</L>
<L>In this restor'd, free, and licentious age?</L>
<L>For Plays are Images of life, and cheat</L>
<L>Men into vertue, and in jest repeat</L>
<L>What they most seriously think; nor may</L>
<L>We fear lest Manners suffer: every day</L>
<L>Does higher, cunninger, more sin invent</L>
<L>Then any Stage did ever represent.</L>
<L>It may indeed shew evil, and affright,</L>
<L>As we prize day by th' ugliness of night.</L>
<L>But in the Theatre men are easier caught,</L>
<L>Then by what is in clamorous pulpits taught.</L>

But to come to the point; Fy, what a stir I had to make her to receive the letter, and when she had received it, to open it, and then to read it; nay, to read it again and again; that as I am a very woman, a man might have wrong my smock dropping wet, with the pure sweat that came from my body. Friend, I took such pains with her. Oh my conscience, to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> a child at those years would not trouble me half so much as the delivery of that letter did.</P>

<P>Why look ye, Mistris, all what <HI>I</HI> say if you mark it well, is just nothing; As for example, To tell you that you are fair, is nothing, for you know it your self; to say you were honest, were an indignity to your beauty, and upon the matter nothing, for honesty in a fair woman is as good as nothing.</P>

<L>Your honor; I will be the man my self</L>

<P>True, true, Sir, you are set high upon the stage for action. O the top of my ambition, my hearts Idol!</P>
<P>What a perplexity are you twin'd into? And justly; so justly, that it is hard to judge, whether your happiness were greater in the possession of an unmatch∣able beauty, or your present misery, by inforcing that beauty to expose her ho∣nor to so apparent a contempt: This is not the least, that might have been in time prevented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<L>O I am lost <HI>Muretto,</HI> my sunke eyes</L>
<L>Are buried in their hollows: busie thoughts</L>
<L>Press on like legions of infernal hags</L>
<L>To menace my destruction: Yet my judgment</L>
<L>Still prompts my senses, that my Queen is fair.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muret.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fair! Unspeakable workman∣ship of Heavens bounty. Were all the skilsullest Painters that ever discern'd colours, moulded into one, to perfect an Artist. Yet that Artist should sooner want fansie or imagination, for perso∣nating a curious medal, then ever to patern a counterfeit so exquisitely ex∣cellent, as is the Queen by nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have surveyed the wonder of her cheeks,</L>
<L>Compar'd them wth the lillies and the rose</L>

And by my life, <HI>Muretto,</HI> Roses are</L>
<L>Adulterate to her blush, and lilies pale,</L>
<L>Examin'd with her white; yet, blear eyed fool,</L>
<L>I could not see those rarities before me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muret.</SPEAKER>
<L>Every man is blind (my lord) in his own happiness, there's the curse of our mortality.</L>
<L>She was the very tale of the world:</L>
<L>Her perfections busied all tongues.</L>
<L>She was the onely wish of <HI>Europes</HI> chief∣est Monarchs.</L>
<L>Whose full fruition you (and 'twas your capital sin) most inhumanly abandoned.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Villain, <HI>Petruchi,</HI> let me for ever curse him: Had he not been the man; who else had durst to hazard a denyal from her scorns?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muret.</SPEAKER>
<P>See now herein you are mon∣strous discourteous, above excuse; why, Sir, what hath <HI>Petruchi</HI> done? Which (from any King to a Vassal) al men would not eagerly have persued. Alas, my lord, his nobleness is eternal, by this means, in attempting and his felicity unmatchable, in injoying the glory of his time, a beau so conquering, so unparalell'd.</P>

<P>Build you a Palace, arch it with Diamonds, roof it with Carbun∣cles, pave it with Emraulds, daub it with Gold, furnish it with all what cost can lay on, and then seal up the doors, and at best 'tis but a solitary nest for Owles and Daws.</P>
<P>Beauty was not meerly created for won∣der, but for use: 'Tis you were in the fault; 'tis you perswaded her, urg'd, compell'd, inforc'd her: I know it, my truth and plainness trumpets it out to ye: Besides, women (my lord) are all creatures, nor Gods nor Angels.</P>

<P>'Tis a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eroical disposition, and with your honour she cannot, must not live.

<L>I cannot be alone, still I am hunted</L>
<L>With my confounding thoughts: Too late I finde,</L>
<L>How passions at their best are but sly traytors</L>
<L>To ruin honour. That which we call love,</L>
<L>Was by the wisest power above fore∣thought</L>
<L>To check our pride. Thus when men are blown up</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Velas.</SPEAKER>
<L>Are you a true very lover, or are you bound</L>
<L>For pennance to walk to some holy shrine</L>
<L>In visitation? I have seen that face.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Salas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you so? O you are a hot lover; a woman is in fine case to weep out her eyes for so uncertain a friend, as your protestations urg'd me to conceive you: But come I know what you'll say aforehand, <HI>I</HI> know you are angry.</P>

<P>I was too blame, but one fault (me thinks) is to be pardoned, when I am yours and you firmly mine: I'll bear with many in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Velas.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, if you be in earnest; What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Salas.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sum of all is, that <HI>I</HI> know it suits not with the bravery of the lord <HI>Velasco</HI>'s spirit, to suffer his Queen and soveraign stand wrongfully accused of dishonour, and dye shamefully for a fault never committed.</P>
</SP>

<L>Speak it no more. Let's rise, now I am King</L>
<L>Of two rich Kingdoms, as the world af∣fords:</L>
<L>The Kingdom of thy beauty, and this land.</L>
<L>But what rests for <HI>Muretto?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qu.</SPEAKER>
<P>I account my worthiest thanks his debt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he deserves all honor, all respect.</P>

<SP>

<L>Thus my imbraces</L>

<SPEAKER>Lodov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay when I am dead I, will appear again, clap thee on the shoulder and cry, God a' mercy old Suresby.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Petr.</SPEAKER>
<L>I must ask pardon of him, still I thought</L>
<L>His plot had aim'd all at his own be∣hoof,</L>
<L>But I am sorry for that misconceit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muret.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lords, What I have been heretofore, I cannot altogether excuse; but I am sure my desires were alwaies <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onest, however my low fortune kept me down: But now I finde 'tis your ho∣nest man is your honest man still, how∣ere the world go.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Muretto,</HI> Whilst I live thou shalt be neer me,</L>
<L>As thou deservest: And noble Gentle∣men</L>
<L>I am in all your debts: henceforth be∣leeve me,</L>
<L>I'll strive to be a servant to the State.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Long live happy both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<L>But where are now my brace of new-made Courtiers,</L>
<L>My Scholler and my Captain?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lodov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cry guilty, there is a large story depends upon their exploits, my Lord; for both they thinking in such pe∣rilous times to be shifting every man for one, have took a passing provident course to live without help hereafter. The man in the moon, Signior <HI>Pynto,</HI> for the raising of his fortune a Planet higher, is by this time married to a kinde of loose-bodied widow, called by Sirname a Bawde; one that if he follow wholesom instructions, will maintain him, there's no question on't, the captain for his part, is somwhat more delicately resolv'd for as adventurous (though not as srail) a piece of service. For he in hope to marry this lady, at∣tending on the Queen, granted <HI>Petruchi</HI> his liberty, and by this time hath recei∣ved a sufficient <HI>quietus est.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are these my trusty servants? What a blindness was I led into!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lodov.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Highnesses both will in these daies of mirth crown the Co∣medy; first let me from the Queens roy∣al gift be bold to receive <HI>Herophil</HI> for my wife; She and I are resolv'd of the bu∣siness already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qu.</SPEAKER>
<L>With all my heart, I think her well bestow'd,</L>
<L>If she her self consents.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<L>My duty, Madam,</L>
<L>Shall ever speak my thankfulness, in this</L>
<L>I reckon all my services rewarded.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lodov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My duty to my Soveraigns, to all therest at once, my heartiest hearti∣est thanks. Now, lady, you are mine; why so, here's short work to begin with. If in the end we make long work, and beget a race of mad-caps, we shall but do as our fathers and mothers did, and they must be cared for.</P>

<L>Hence you ridiculous fools, I banish you</L>
<L>For ever from my presence: Sirrah, to thee</L>
<L>I give the charge, that they be forth with stript,</L>
<L>And put into such rags they came to Court in;</L>
<L>And so turn'd off.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Pyn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dost hear me King?</P>

<P>No more I say.</P>

<P>Come away, come away for shame, you see what 'tis to be given to the flesh: the itch of letchery must be cured with the whip of correction. Away, away.</P>

<SPEAKER>Salas.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your looks proclaim</L>
<L>My sentence banishment, or if you think</L>
<L>The word of banishment too hard to ut∣ter.</L>
<L>But turn away, my lord, and without accent</L>
<L>I'll understand my doom, I'll take my leave,</L>
<L>And like a penitentiary walk</L>
<L>Many miles hence to a religious shrine</L>
<L>Of some chast sainted Nun, and wash my fin off</L>
<L>In tears of penance, to my last of breath.</L>
</SP>

<P>You come to new torment me.</P>

<L>Nay, nay, I must not be deny'd, my Queen</L>

<L>Yes, I dare undertake, she that presents</L>
<L>Her pennance in such sorrow, heartys or∣row,</L>
<L>Will know how to redeem the time with duty,</L>
<L>With love, obedience.</L>

<SPEAKER>Lodov.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ee hear, my lord; all the la∣dies in <HI>Arragon,</HI> and my wife among the rest, will bait ye like so many wild cats,
<PB REF="24"/>
if you should triumph over a poor yeel∣ding creature, that does in a manner lye down to ye of her own accord. Come, I know you love her with all the very vaines of your heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muret.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's more hope of one wo∣man reclaim'd (my lord) then of ma∣ny conceited of their own innocence, which indeed they never have but in conceit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Velas.</SPEAKER>
<L>To strive against the ordinance of fate,</L>
<L>I finde is all in vain: Lady, your hand,</L>
<L>I must confess I love you, and I hope</L>
<L>Our faults shall be redeem'd in being henceforth</L>
<L>True votaries to vertue, and the faith</L>
<L>Our mutual vows shal to each other ow.</L>

<SPEAKER>Salas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yours, as you please to have me:</P>

<SPEAKER>Velas.</SPEAKER>
<L>Here then ends</L>
<L>All memory of any former strife:</L>
<L>He hath enough who hath a vertuous wife.</L>

<L>The money we return</L>
<L>Where it is due; and for <HI>Velasco</HI>'s merits</L>
