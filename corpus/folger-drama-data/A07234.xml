<P>HOw euer I could neuer arriue at the happinesse to be made knowne to your Lordship, yet a desire borne with me, to make tender of all du∣ties, and seruice, to the Noble Family of the <HI>Her∣berts,</HI> descended to me as an inheritance from my dead Father, <HI>Arthur Massinger.</HI> Many yeares hee happily spent in the seruice of your Honourable House, and dyed a seruant to it; leauing his, to be euer most glad, and ready, to be at the command of al such, as deriue themselues from his most ho∣nour'd Master, your Lordships most noble Father. The consideration of this, encouraged me (hauing no other meanes to present my humblest seruice to your Honour) to shrowde this trifle, vnder the

wings of your Noble protection; and I hope out of the clemency of your Heroique disposition, it will finde, though perhaps not a welcome enter∣tainment, yet at the worst a gratious pardon. When it was first Acted, your Lordships liberall suffrage taught others to allow it for currant, it hauing receaued the vndoubted stampe of your Lordships allowance: and if in the perusall of any vacant houre, when your Honours more serious occasions shall giue you leaue to reade it, it an∣swer in your Lordships iudgement, the report and opinion it had vpon the Stage, I shall esteeme my labours not ill imployde, and while I liue continue,</P>

<L>The cunning, and corrupting Arts they studie,</L>
<L>That wander in the wilde Maze of desire;</L>
<L>Honest simplicitie, and Truth were all</L>
<L>The Agents I imployd, and when I came</L>
<L>To see you, it was with that reuerence,</L>

<L>To leaue his Arrowes, and his Torch behinde,</L>
<L>Quench'd in my feare to giue offence.</L>

<L>Am I fall'n so lowe</L>
<L>My birth, my honour, and what's dearest to me,</L>
<L><PB REF="42"/>My loue, and witnesse of my loue, my seruice,</L>
<L>So vnder-valewd, that I must contend</L>
<L>With one, where my excesse of glory must</L>
<L>Make his o'rethrow a conquest? shall my fulnesse</L>
<L>supply defects in such a thing, that neuer</L>
<L>Knew any thing but want and emptinesse?</L>
<L>Giue him a name, and keepe it such from this</L>
<L>Vnequall competition? if my pride</L>
<L>Or any bold assurance of my worth,</L>
<L>Has pluck'd this mountaine of disgrace vpon me,</L>
<L>I am iustly punish'd, and submit; but if</L>
<L>I haue beene modest, and esteem'd my selfe</L>
<L>More iniur'd in the tribute of the praise,</L>
<L>Which no desert of mine priz'd by selfe-loue</L>
<L>Euer exacted; may this cause, and minute</L>
<L>For euer be forgotten. I dwell long</L>

<L>You nourish, Lady</L>

<L>You are all made vp of passion. For if reason</L>

<L>Or that you would distinguish of the obiects</L>
<L>You looke on in a true glasse, not feduc'd</L>
<L>By the false light of your too violent will,</L>
<L>I should not need to plead for that, which you</L>
<L>With ioy should offer. Is my high birth a blemish?</L>
<L>Or does my wealth, which all the vaine expence</L>
<L>Of women cannot waste, breed loathing in you?</L>
<L>The honours I can call mine owne thought scandals?</L>

<L>As crimes, 'tis fit I should yeeld vp my selfe</L>

<L>(Which yet I would not credit) you haue seene</L>
<L>This gallant, pitch the barre, or beare a burthen</L>

<L>Of my ambitious hopes (in ayming at</L>
<L>The glad possession of a happinesse,</L>
<L>The abstract of all goodnesse in mankinde</L>
<L>Can at no part deserue) with my confession</L>
