<P>Hang you, you haue bewitcht me among you, I was as well giuen till I fell to be wicked, my Grandsire had hope of me, I went all in blacke, swore but a Sundaies, neuer came home drunke, but vpon fasting nights to clense my sto∣macke; sl'id now I'me quite altered, blowne into light co∣lours, let out othes by'th minute, sit vp late till it bee early, drinke drunke till I am sober, sincke downe dead in a Ta∣uerne, and rise in a Tabacco-shop: her's a transformation: I was wont yet to pitie the simple, and leaue e'm some money: sl'id, now I gull e'm without conscience; I goe without order, sweare without number, gull without mercie, &amp; drinke without measure.</P>
