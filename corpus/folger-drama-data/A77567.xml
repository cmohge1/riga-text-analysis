<HEAD>TO THE READERS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>R rather <HI>to the Spe∣ctators,</HI> if the Fates so pleas'd, these <HI>Come∣dies</HI> exactly being dressed for the <HI>Stage;</HI> and the often-tried <HI>Author</HI> (better than many who can but scribble) under∣stood the <HI>Proportions</HI> and <HI>Beauties</HI> of a <HI>Scene;</HI> But as they are they will not deceive you; for the same hand (which formerly pleas'd) now held the Pen. VVe suppose we bring what in these dayes you scarce could hope for, <HI>Five</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>new Playes</HI> We call them <HI>new,</HI> because till now they never were printed. You must not think them <HI>posthumous</HI> Pro∣ductions, though they come into the world after the <HI>Author's</HI> death: they were all begotten and born (and own'd by Him before a thousand witnesses) many years since; they then trod the <HI>Stage</HI> (their proper place) though they pass'd not the <HI>Press.</HI> They are all <HI>Comedies,</HI> for (a man would think) we have had too many <HI>Tra∣gedies.</HI> But this Book knew them not. The <HI>ENGLISH MOOR</HI> here (what ever name or face it wears) is older than our Troubles. The <HI>LOVE-SICK COURT,</HI> and the <HI>AMBITIOUS POLITICK</HI> are but one Play, though strange those two should dwell toge∣ther. This <HI>NEW ACADEMY</HI> con∣cerns not that which eight years since peep'd up in <HI>Write Friers;</HI> and this <HI>NEW EXCHANGE</HI> knows no∣thing
<PB REF="4"/>
of that which now is cleaving to the <HI>Great Church</HI> VVall. This <HI>QUEEN</HI> is a meer stranger to our <HI>Island;</HI> Her Scene is <HI>Sicily,</HI> the Persons and Action taste nothing of <HI>England.</HI> Thus the whole <HI>Book</HI> being free and ingenuous, we hope the <HI>Author</HI> may have the same allowance, especially now since he's gone to the great Wits, that is, dead. And yet there are a sort (one would wonder there should be) who think they lessen this <HI>Author's</HI> worth when they speak the relation he had to <HI>Ben. Johnson.</HI> VVe very thankful∣ly embrace the Objection, and desire they would name any other Master that could better teach a man to write a good Play. The materials must flow from all parts of the world; but the <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Composition</HI> come onely from Books and such living Masters as that our great <HI>Laureat;</HI> And for this purpose we have here prefixt <HI>Ben Johnson</HI>'s own
<PB REF="5"/>
testimony to his Servant our <HI>Author;</HI> we grant it is (according to <HI>Ben</HI>'s own nature and custome) magisterial e∣nough; and who looks for other, since he said to <HI>Shakespear—I shall draw envy on thy name</HI> (by writing in his praise) and threw in his face<HI>—small Latine and less Greek;</HI> but also told <HI>Sel∣den</HI> himself (as if <HI>Ben's</HI> conscience checked him for being too good na∣tured in commending others.)</P>
<Q><L><HI>Your Book (my</HI> Selden) <HI>I have read—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though I confess (as every Muse hath err'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And mine not least) I have too oft preferr'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>Men past their terms, and prais'd some names too much,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But twas with purpose to have made them such;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Since, being deceiv'd, I turn a sharper eye</HI></L>
<L><HI>Upon my self, and ask to whom, and why,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And what I write, and vex it many dayes</HI></L>
<L><HI>Before men get a Verse, much less a Praise.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
<HI>—I first salute thee so, and gratulats,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With that thy style, thy keeping of thy state.</HI></L>
<L><HI>—I could take up (and nere abuse</HI></L>
<L><HI>The credit) what would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnish a tenth Muse▪</HI></L>
<L><HI>But here's nor time nor place my wealth to tell;</HI></L>
<L><HI>You both are modest, so am I. Farewel.</HI></L></Q>
<P>It seems (what ere we think) <HI>Ben</HI> thought it diminution for no man to attend upon his Muse. And were not already the Antients too much trod on, we could name famous wits who served far meaner Masters than <HI>Ben Johnson.</HI> For, none vers'd in Letters but know the wise <HI>Aesop</HI> was born and bred a wretched slave; <HI>Lucian</HI> a Stone-cutter, <HI>Virgil</HI> himself begotten by a Basket-maker, born in a ditch, and then prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to an under Groom in the stable; nay, (to instance in our <HI>Authors</HI> own order) <HI>Naevius</HI> the Co∣median a Captains mans man; <HI>Plau∣tus</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
servant to a poor Baker, <HI>Terence</HI> a slave as well as <HI>Aesop;</HI> and (which for our purpose is most of all) our Au∣thors own <HI>Master</HI> handled the <HI>Trowel</HI> before he grew acquainted with <HI>Seia∣nus</HI> or <HI>Cataline.</HI> But enough of this, lest pleading for the <HI>Author,</HI> make him seem to want an Apology. As for the <HI>Stationers,</HI> they bring these <HI>Poems</HI> as they had them from the <HI>Author;</HI> not suffering any false or busy hand to adde or make the least mutilation; ha∣ving been more watchful over the Printers common negligence, than such work as this hath usually obtained. And if these new Playes fail your ex∣pectation, we openly profess we know not how, where, or when we shall fit you.</P>

<HEAD>To my most ingenious friend, Mr. <HI>ALEX. BROME</HI> Upon his setting forth <HI>Mr.</HI> RICH. BROMES <HI>PLAYES:</HI></HEAD>
<L>THis, Sir, is double <HI>Piety,</HI> and you</L>
<L>In this oblige the <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>living</HI> too.</L>
<L>As the last <HI>trumpet</HI> with one pow'rful sound</L>
<L>Raises forgotten <HI>Bodies</HI> from the ground,</L>
<L>And <HI>betters</HI> those that yet remain alive:</L>
<L>So you an equal <HI>happiness</HI> do give</L>
<L>Unto his dust, and us, at once engage</L>
<L>His sacred <HI>Ashes,</HI> and the present <HI>age.</HI></L>
<L>Nor can I tell to whom we more are bound,</L>
<L>Or to his <HI>wit,</HI> or <HI>you</HI> that have it found.</L>
<L>When <HI>Thetis</HI> Son amongst the <HI>maids</HI> lay hid,</L>
<L>And for their softer wars the <HI>Trojan</HI> fled;</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>
He that discover'd him, did justly claim</L>
<L>An equal share in th' honour of his <HI>name;</HI></L>
<L>And da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to call <HI>Achilles</HI> victories,</L>
<L>All those exploits, and all those <HI>Trophies</HI> his:</L>
<L>So <HI>you</HI> that have this noble <HI>wit</HI> reveal'd</L>
<L>And made it be (which was before con∣ceal'd)</L>
<L>Known and commended, may as well re∣ceive</L>
<L>Part in those <HI>Lawrels</HI> we to him do give.</L>
<L>He made the <HI>oyl,</HI> but you enlightned it,</L>
<L>He gave the <HI>salt,</HI> but you have made it white,</L>
<L>And dug it from the <HI>Pit</HI> where it once lay</L>
<L>Unseen, or by the eyes of <HI>men</HI> or <HI>day:</HI></L>
<L>He made the <HI>branches</HI> of this <HI>Coral</HI> grow,</L>
<L>Hid in its private <HI>Sea</HI> untouch'd; but you</L>
<L>By drawing it into the open air,</L>
<L>Have made it turn more <HI>pretious,</HI> and more <HI>fair.</HI></L>
<L>He spake with such a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>easie</HI> strain,</L>
<L>With such a <HI>soft,</HI> and such a <HI>flowing</HI> vein,</L>
<L>As if 'twere <HI>Nature</HI> all, yet there was <HI>Art,</HI></L>
<L>Yet there was <HI>Skill</HI> in every limb and Part.</L>
<L>So gently came all that he thought or writ,</L>
<L>As if he <HI>made</HI> it not, but did <HI>repeat.</HI></L>
<L>His <HI>fancy</HI> like the <HI>blood</HI> did alwayes flow,</L>
<L>Yet full of <HI>life</HI> and full of <HI>spirts</HI> too.</L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>
His <HI>wit</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI> did in this a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ee,</L>
<L>Their <HI>motion</HI> is most nimble, quick, and free,</L>
<L>And <HI>perfect</HI> too. And as the <HI>world</HI> was made,</L>
<L>(Which no delayes of <HI>spring</HI> and <HI>summer</HI> had,</L>
<L>No <HI>ages</HI> or <HI>increases,</HI> but on all</L>
<L>At first a <HI>ripeness,</HI> and full <HI>growth</HI> did fall;</L>
<L>So all that from his happy <HI>Pen</HI> did come</L>
<L>Was ripe and grown at first, and left no room</L>
<L>For after <HI>change,</HI> no <HI>second</HI> hand could give</L>
<L>More <HI>strength</HI> to it, or it more <HI>strength</HI> re∣ceive.</L>
<L>When he doth speak of <HI>love,</HI> himself he arms</L>
<L>With such <HI>resistless,</HI> and such <HI>conquering</HI> charms,</L>
<L>Acts such sweet <HI>hopes,</HI> such innocent <HI>fears,</HI> and <HI>joyes,</HI></L>
<L>That we or love his <HI>Mistress,</HI> or his <HI>voice,</HI></L>
<L>As <HI>eccho</HI> did. When he would make us smile,</L>
<L>Thousand <HI>Anacreons</HI> play about his style.</L>
<L>When he commands our <HI>sorrow,</HI> straight our eyes</L>
<L>Into salt <HI>streams,</HI> our hearts to <HI>sighings</HI> rise.</L>
<L>When he doth <HI>laugh</HI> again, the <HI>clouds</HI> are gone,</L>
<L><PB REF="9"/>
Our minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to a sudden calmness run:</L>
<L>He so dispos'd our thoughts, as when the hand,</L>
<L>Or eye of the chief <HI>Gen'ral</HI> doth command,</L>
<L>Whole <HI>Armies</HI> act what his example led,</L>
<L>Follow his postures with such willing speed,</L>
<L>Into obedience with such <HI>eafiness</HI> fall,</L>
<L>As if one <HI>soul</HI> and <HI>spring</HI> did move them all.</L>
<L>When he strook <HI>vice,</HI> he let the <HI>person</HI> go,</L>
<L>Wounded not <HI>men</HI> but <HI>manners;</HI> nor did do</L>
<L>Like him who when he painted <HI>heaven</HI> &amp; <HI>hel,</HI></L>
<L>Amongst the <HI>damned</HI> shades and those that fell,</L>
<L>Did draw his Enemies face, that all might say</L>
<L><HI>Who there condemned by the Painter lay:</HI></L>
<L>But as the <HI>Surgeon</HI> at once <HI>hides</HI> and <HI>cures,</HI></L>
<L>And bindeth up the <HI>limb</HI> which most in∣dures</L>
<L>The <HI>sore</HI> and <HI>pain:</HI> so he with gentle hand</L>
<L>Did heal the <HI>wound,</HI> and yet conceal the <HI>man.</HI></L>
<L>His Scenes mens <HI>Actions, Tempers, Humours</HI> shew,</L>
<L>And <HI>copy</HI> out what the great <HI>world</HI> doth do.</L>
<L>His words are like the shapes which <HI>Angels</HI> take,</L>
<L>And for themselves of finest <HI>air</HI> do make,</L>

<L>MOst noble, fair and curteous, to ye all</L>
<L>Welcome and thanks we give, that you would call</L>
<L>And visit your poor servants, that have been</L>
<L>So long and pitiless unheard, unseen.</L>
<L>Welcome, you'l say your money that does do,</L>
<L>(Dissembling is a fault) we say so too.</L>
<L>And your long absence was no fault of your,</L>
<L>But our sad fate to be so long obscure.</L>
<L>Jove and the Muses grant, and all good Men,</L>
<L>We feel not that extremity again:</L>
<L>The thought of which yet chills us with a fear</L>
<L>That we have bought our liberty too dear:</L>
<L>For should we fall into a new restraint,</L>
<L>Our hearts must break that did before but faint.</L>
<L>You noble, great and good ones, that vouchsafe</L>
<L>To see a Comedy, and sometimes laugh</L>
<L>Or smile at wit and harmeless mirth, As thus</L>
<L>ye have begun to grace and succour us;</L>
<L>Be further pleas'd (to hold us still upright,</L>
<L>For our r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lief, and for your own delight)</L>
<L>To move for us to those high powers whom we</L>
<L>submit unto in all humility,</L>
<L>For our proceeding, and we'le make it good</L>
<L>To utter nothing may be understood</L>
<L>Offensive to the state, manners or time,</L>
<L>We will as well look to our necks as climb.</L>
<L>You hear our sute, obtain it if you may;</L>
<L>Then find us money and we'le find you play.</L>

<L>Now my good Host, since you have been our friend</L>

And onely councel keeper in our absence,</L>
<L>To you, before we visit our own houses</L>
<L>We'le render a relation of our journey,</L>
<L>And what the motive was that drew us forth.</L>
<L>'Tis true, we did pretend a deadly quarrel</L>
<L>At a great bowling match upon <HI>Black-heath;</HI></L>
<L>Went off; took horse; and several wayes, forecast</L>
<L>To meet at <HI>Dover,</HI> where we met good friends,</L>
<L>And in one Barque past over into <HI>France:</HI></L>
<L>Here 'twas suppos'd to fight, like fashion followers</L>
<L>That thither flie, as if no sand but theirs</L>
<L>Could dry up English blood.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Now, by the way,</L>
<L>Suppose that supposition had been true,</L>
<L>And the supposed deaths of you, and you</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>Now let me be a modost undertaker</L>
<L>For us the players, the play and the play-maker:</L>
<L>If we have faild in speech or Action, we</L>
<L>Must crave a pardon; If the Commedy</L>
<L>Either in mirth, or matter be not right,</L>
<L>As 'twas intended unto your delight,</L>
<L>The Poet in hope of favour doth submit</L>
<L>Ʋnto your censure both himself and it,</L>
<L>Wishing that as y'are judges in the cause</L>
<L>You judge but by the antient Comick Lawes.</L>
<L>Not by their course who in this latter age</L>
<L>Have sown such pleasing errors on the stage,</L>
<L>Which he no more will chuse to imitate</L>
<L>Then they to fly from truth, and run the State.</L>
<L>But whether I avail, you have seen the play,</L>
<L>And all that in defence the Poet can say</L>
<L>Is, that he cannot mend it by a jest</L>
<L>I'th Epilogue exceeding all the rest;</L>
<L>To send you off upon a champing bit,</L>
<L>More then the scenes afforded of his wit:</L>
<L>Nor studies he the Art to have it said</L>
<L>He sculks behind the hangings as affraid</L>
<L>Of a hard censure, or pretend to brag</L>
<L>Here's all your money again brought in i'th bag</L>
<L>If you applaud not, when before the word</L>
<L>'Twas parcel'd out upon the shearing-board.</L>
<L>Such are fine helps; but are not practised yet</L>
<L>By our plain Poet who cannot forget</L>
<L>His wonted modesty, and humble way</L>
<L>For him and us, and his yet doubtful play,</L>
<L>Which, if receiv'd or but allow'd by you,</L>
<L>We and the play are yours, the Poet too.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>I</HI> am glad that my father yielded to your fathers friendly request in it; and the more, in regard he is so hard to be entreated to any thing; but especially for your societies sake, sweet Sister. In∣deed I'le call you Sister alwayes, and I hope you shall be shortly in my brother <HI>Mihils</HI> right.</P>

<P>Why you would not have him too, Sister, would you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>His consent <HI>I</HI> would, and my fathers, <HI>I</HI> hope, would easily be wrought. You saw he was willing your other brother should have me at the first sight, meerly for his reservednesse, and <HI>Mihil</HI> methought carried himself as civil to day as he; <HI>I</HI> mean, as ci∣villy for a Gentleman, that should not look like one fathers of the Dutch Church at five and twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He was put to't to day. The noise of the Tavern had almost wrought his zeale in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o fury, it is scarce out of my head yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But you were about to tell me how he first fell into this veine, this vanity indeed.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> will observe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father has an humour, not to like any thing at first, nor accept best courtesies of friends,
<PB N="51" REF="127"/>
though presently he findes 'em most commodious to him; things that he knows not how to be without, and oftentimes desires with the same breath the things he vilisied, and scorn'd them the last syllable he spake before. You saw when your father offered him the use of his house here, till his own be furnished, he cried, hah <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are all the houses in the Town yours Sir; and yet presently entreated for't, and thanked him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That shews the best nature, they say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kat.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is seldome attended by the best fortune. Nay, in us, <HI>I</HI> mean, his children, he will like nothing, no, not those actions which he him∣self cannot deny are vertuous; he will crosse us in all we do, as if there were no other way to shew his power over our obedience.</P>

<P>'Tis a strange fatherly care.</P>
</SP>

<P>Now, note the punishment that followes it.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that's as odde a duty in children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kat.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> must confesse it is a stubbornnesse.</P>
<P>Yet for the most part we do nothing, but that which most Parents would allow in their children: and now for my brother <HI>Gabriel,</HI> with whom I must bring in the story of another Kinswoman of ours, my father had at home with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, mark, <HI>I</HI> pray you, as <HI>I</HI> would entreat an Auditorie, if <HI>I</HI> now were a Poet to mark the Plot, and several points of my play, that they might not say when 'tis done, they understood not this or that, or how such a part came in or went out, because they did not observe the passages.</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> mean in outvvard conversation, he vvas the Ring-leader of all the youthful Frie, to Faires, to Wakes, to May-games, footbal-matches, any thing that had but noise and tumult in it; then he was Captain of the young train-band, and exercised the youth of tvventy parishes in martial discipline.

<P>WHat has this Coxscombe <HI>Cockbrayne</HI> writ me here? That he desires his ab∣sence be excus'd. What have I to do with him? when I send for him, let him come to me. That he is up∣on a point of discovery in a most excellent project for the weeding of this Garden? what Garden? what project? A project he says here for the good of the Republike, Repudding. This fellow has in stead of braines, a Cob-web in his Noddle, with little strawes, feathers, and wings of dead Butterflies hanging in it, that having motion by his aery fancie, there dance and keep a Racket; 'tis to teach women silence, or some such foolish impossibility. He is ambitious to be call'd into authority by notice taken of some spe∣cial service he is able to do the tate aforehand. But what great service he is able to do it, or which way to undertake it, falls not in the reach of my imaginati∣on. But good Mr. <HI>Croswill,</HI> by your favour now, what reason have you to slight or wrangle at this man? this honest <HI>Cockbrayne?</HI> that has alwayes been a con∣stant friend to you, and officious in many good wayes, and is a Gentleman, not only of good descent and e∣state, but of a good disposition. And you two, Mr. <HI>Crossewill,</HI> by your leave, have alwayes agreed like

I, the divel was in't, and now he vexes me again; we agreed in one point so well, that we have undone a couple of our children by it, and hindred the getting of <HI>I</HI> know not how many more. His son and my daughter should have married. And on a sndden he and I both consented to a dislike of the match and broke it, and have both repented it an hundred times since. We agree very wel in that point; and now is his son irrecoverably lost, and my daughter resolutely bent to be an Ape-leader in <HI>Limbo.</HI> But whats all this to the affliction I suffer in my sons now? that one of them from a riotous boy. should grow into a Puritanical Woodcock; and the tother from a civil well-qualified fellow, turn'd absolute Ruffian. There, there, <HI>I</HI> there's the devil in't. <HI>I</HI> could beat my selfe for getting such children.</P>
