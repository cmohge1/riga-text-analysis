<P><HI>My Lord,</HI></P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Honour of your Name, and cleerenesse of Soule, which want no living Monuments in the heart of Princes, have already made the Title of this Poëme inno∣cent, though not the Author; who confesseth his guilt of a long ambition, by some Service to be knowne to you, and his boldnesse at last, by this rude attempt to kisse your Lordships hands.</P>
<P>Fame with one breath hath possessed the world with your Lordships general knowledge, &amp; excellēt Nature, both, an ornament to your blood, &amp; in both you stand the rare, and iustified example to our age. To the last, these cold papers addresse themselves, which if (with truce to your richer contemplations) you vouchsafe to read and smile upon, not onely
<PB REF="3"/>
they shall receive a life, beyond what the <HI>Scene</HI> ex∣actly gave them, in the presentment, rewarded with frequent applause, but your Lordship shall infinitely honour him, whose glory is to be mentioned.</P>

<L>From this learn'd Worke, which Marble could not doe:</L>
<L>Ambitious to posterity to send</L>

Here hee stands, whose birth I will not touch, because its altogether un∣knowne who begot him: He was brought up among the smal wares in the Cittie, became rich by sinister and indirect practi∣ses, married a Merchants wife at adventures, and was soone after advanc'd to be a Head-officer.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you rascall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace sirra, peace, nay your Lordships shall finde him very audacious: This fellow not content to have his branches spread within the Cittie, I speake it to his face, let him denie it, was afterward by the corruption of his confederate, and the meere grace of his highnesse raised to honour, received infi∣nite favours from his Prince of blessed memorie, yet like a wretch, a villaine, a viper, a Rat of <HI>Nilus,</HI> he hath practised Treasons against the sacred person of the Duke, for which he de∣serveth not onely to die, but also to suffer tortures, whips, racks, strapadoes, wheeles, and all the fiery brazen bulls that can bee in∣vented, as I shall make it appeare to this honourable and il∣lustrious Court.</P>

<P>With all my heart I obey your Lordships—thus then I passe from these circumstances, and proceed to the principall villanies that wee have to lay to his charge. Imprimis
<PB REF="19"/>
thou Signior <HI>Depazzi</HI> didst offer to a groome a 100 crownes to poyson his highnes hunting saddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not interrupt mee varlet I will proove it, his hunting saddle, and woe shall be unto thy breech therefore, and finding this serpentive treason broken in the shell, doe but lend your reverend eares to his next designes I will cut em off presently. This irreligious nay Atheistical Traitor, did with his owne hands poyson the Dukes prayer booke, oh impiety! and had his highnes as in former times, hee accustomed but pray'd once in a month, which by speciall grace hee omitted, how fatall had it beene to <HI>Florence?</HI> but as by justice his excellence did then, and by his owne want of devotion, prevent this assasinates purpose, so we hope in his owne discretion, and the councell of his state, hee will take heed how he prayes hereafter while hee lives, to which every true subject will say Amen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dep.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it please your honors—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou impudent brazen fac'd Traitor, wilt thou deny it? more over, and like your good Lordships, hee hath for this fort∣night or three weekes before his apprehension, walk'd up and downe the Court with a case of pistols charg'd wherewith, as he partly confessed, hee intended to send the Duke to heaven with a powder.</P>

<P>This rogue will undoe the Divell at inuention, may it please this honorable—</P>

<P>Will you justifie this? did I any of these things you tadpole?</P>

<P>Hold your selfe contented my Lord, he that is brought t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the barre in case of treason, must looke to have more objected then hee can answere, or any man is able to justifie.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thats the the way to be sent of a headles errand▪ indeed I confesse that I never intēded any treasō to his highnes, nor ever sought the princes life, true it is, that I heard of a conpiracie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That that my Lord hath overthrowne him, he saieth hee never sought the princes life, <HI>ergo</HI> he sought his death, besides he hath heard of treason, now he that heareth and discovereth not is

equally guilty in fact: for in offences of this nature there are not accessaries, <HI>ergo</HI> hee is a principall, and beeing a principal Traitor, hee deserveth condemnation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I not speake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, traitors must not be sufferd to speake, for when they have leave, they have liberty, and hee that is a Traitor deserveth to bee close Prisoner.</P>

<L>Practis'd already, and though no man see't,</L>
<L>Nor scarse the eye of Heaven, yet every day</L>
<L>I kill a Prince, appeare thou Tragicke witnesse.</L>

<STAGE>Hee discovers the Dukes Picture, a Ponyard sticking in it.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>Which though it bleed not, I may boast a Murder:</L>
<L>Here first the Duke was painted to the life:</L>
<L>But with this Pencill to the death: I love</L>
<L>My braine for the invention, and thus</L>
<L>Confirm'd, dare trust my resolution.</L>
<L>I did suspect his youth, and beautie might</L>
<L>Winne some compassion when J came to kill him:</L>
<L>Or the remembrance that he <HI>is</HI> my Kinsman,</L>
<L>Might thrill my blood: or something in his Title,</L>
<L>Might give my hand repulse, and startle Nature:</L>
<L>But thus J have arm'd my selfe against all pittie,</L>
<L>That when J come to strike, my Ponyard may</L>
<L>Through all his charmes as confidently wound him,</L>
<L>As thus J stab his Picture, and stare on it.</L>
<L>Me thinkes the Duke should feele me now: is not</L>
<L>His soule acquainted; can he lesse then tremble</L>
<L>When J lift up my arme to wound his counterfeit?</L>
<L>Witches can persecute the lives of whom</L>
<L>They hate, when they torment their sencelesse figures,</L>
<L>And sticke the waxen modell full of pinnes.</L>
<L>Can any stroke of mine carrie lesse spell</L>
