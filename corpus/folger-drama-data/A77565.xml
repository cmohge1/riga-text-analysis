<P>BEING to write to a multitude of you, (for I know you will be many) I forbear <HI>Epithets,</HI> because the same will not fit all; and I hate to make difference among Freinds. I have often considered with my selfe, whether I were best to Dedicate this Booke or no; and I have thought on the maine ends of Dedi∣cations, which I finde generally to be <HI>Flattery</HI> or <HI>Want.</HI> To the one my nature was ever averse: And (were my Debts all payd to me and by me) I should not be much concerned in the other. As for the two ordinary pretences, namely, <HI>Gratitude,</HI> or <HI>Patron∣age,</HI> like Religion and Liberty, they are made but the Vizors to somewhat else. For is it not a high peice of <HI>Gratitude,</HI> when an <HI>Author</HI> has received fa∣vours from his <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> to requite him with a Booke; and to take, or expect, two or three <HI>Peices</HI> from him for it, when another man shall buy the same Book of the thriving <HI>Stationers,</HI> for halfe a Crowne? And for <HI>Patronage</HI> or <HI>Protection,</HI> I
<PB REF="4"/>
would faine know, if an <HI>Author</HI> writes like a <HI>Cockscombe,</HI> whether any <HI>Patron</HI> can protect him from being laught at. And he that writes well, makes every one his <HI>Patron</HI> without a Dedication.</P>
<P>But in Epistles of this nature, something is usually begg'd; and I would do so too, but, I vow, am puz∣led, <HI>what.</HI> Tis not <HI>acceptance,</HI> for then youle ex∣pect I should <HI>give</HI> it; tis not <HI>Money,</HI> for then I shou'd loose my <HI>labour;</HI> tis not <HI>praise,</HI> for the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> bid me tell you, that, now he is dead, he is of <HI>Falstaffs</HI> winde, and cares not for <HI>Honour;</HI> tis not <HI>pardon,</HI> for that supposes a fault, which (I beleeve) you cannot finde.

<L>SInce Poems of this nature, honest Freind,</L>
<L>Do, of themselves, nor praise nor discomend</L>
<L>An Author or his Work; but He, and It,</L>
<L>Must by the Readers Palate rise or set;</L>
<L>What need we write Encomiums, or expose</L>
<L>Our judging Rhymes, to be laught at in Prose?</L>
<L>We're like Godfathers (as they're us'd of late)</L>
<L>Not to Engage for Children, but give Plate.</L>
<L>And truely scarce there is a Poet known,</L>
<L>That praises others wit, but clawes his own.</L>
<L>But tis the Custome, and who won't submit,</L>
<L>Must be esteem'd a Schismatick in wit:</L>
<L>And therefore in obedience to the power,</L>
<L>Ile tell the World, I've read these Poems o're,</L>
<L>And in them finde so naturall a vaine</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>Of clean, rich Fancie, in so pure a straine:</L>
<L>That I may safely say, who does not love it,</L>
<L>Can't for his life write any thing above it.</L>
<L>This witty Pen, this mirthfull Comick style,</L>
<L>Makes us at once both serious, and smile.</L>
<L>Wraps serious truths in fab'lous mysteries,</L>
<L>And thereby makes us merry, and yet wise.</L>
<L>No Gods, or Goddesses his rimes supply'd,</L>
<L>One he ador'd, and all the rest defy'd.</L>
<L>No stradling Tetrasyllables are brought</L>
<L>To fill up room, and little spell, or nought.</L>
<L>No Bumbast Raptures, and no lines immense,</L>
<L>That's call'd (by th' curtesie of <HI>England</HI>) sence.</L>
<L>But all's so plaine, that one may see, he made it</L>
<L>T' inform the understanding, not invade it.</L>
<L>And the designes so probable, that though</L>
<L>They be not true, tis like they may be so.</L>
<L>Thus Travellour-like, I do inform our Nation,</L>
<L>Being return'd, what is my Observation.</L>
<L>But if, as <HI>Coriat</HI> did, I do relate</L>
<L>Buildings, and Gallowses, not Acts of State;</L>
<L>Pardon my want of skill, and Ile be Debtor</L>

<L><HI>Wit</HI> shall be cherisht, and <HI>Poets</HI> finde a <HI>Friend.</HI></L>
<L>This makes these sleeping <HI>Poems</HI> now creep forth,</L>
<L>As innocent of wrong, as full of worth.</L>
<L>Where <HI>Vice,</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> are laught to scorn,</L>
<L>And unstain'd <HI>Vertue</HI> to the <HI>Skies</HI> is born.</L>
<L>May this <HI>Work</HI> prove successefull, and we finde</L>

<L>And give encouragement to <HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Worth,</HI></L>

<P>Yes Sir, to Mr. <HI>Saveall</HI> your Unkles friend: But hee has stood your friend so long, and so often, to so little purpose in moving your Unkle for you, that he holds it utterly in vaine, to urge him any further, he told me.</P>

<P>Thou should'st ha' told him, I would not be so answer'd.</P>

<P>Yes; and then he would have told me, let your Master take his course.</P>

<P>Then you should ha' told him again, I have taken all the courses I could, or as any Gentleman can to main∣taine my selfe like one; But all my courses are run out, and I have not breath, nor know any ground whereon to begin a new one, unlesse that thing my Unkle sets me

up againe, nor have I any meanes to attaine to that, but by his Mediation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then would he ha' told me againe, what all your courses have been. Namely, running into debt by all the wayes can be imagin'd, and cheating by all could be in∣vented, then that the said thing, (as you call it) your Unkle, before he cast you quite off, had redeem'd you out of Prison, and severall holds, within the space of 15. Moneths 14. times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Hee would ha' told me then againe, That seve∣rall Redemptions, cost your Unkle at least 2000 l. And that upon your last revolt when he quite gave you over for a cast-away, two yeares since, he cast the third thou∣sand with you, upon condition never to afflict him more.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I that Marrying spoy'ld all.</P>
</SP>

<P>Because you should not after his death cast away all the rest of the thousands, and ten thousands which you might have liv'd to inherit, if your Unkles love or Mr. <HI>Savealls</HI> counsell could have prevay'd with you against the Divill, and Debauchednes.</P>

<P>Pox on't, let it all goe, let that wretched Unkle goe, and let <HI>Saveall</HI> goe for a punctuall asse as hee is. I confesse he has by his saving helpe peec'd mee with my Unkle a score of times at least. What had once more been to him?</P>

<P>I cannot, nor will I trouble my braines to thinke of any, I will rather die here in <HI>Ram alley,</HI> or walk down to the <HI>Temple,</HI> and lay my selfe down alive, in the old Synagogue, cross-leg'd among the Monumentall Knights there, till I turne Marble with'em.

<P>I ther's the Devill. I would doe something for her if I knew how. But what have I not done that can be done by a forlorn heire?</P>
</SP>

<P>Why though the Dice, and all other Household games, and all the Cheats belonging unto them have fayld you by your and their discoveries, till none dare venture so neare you as a Man hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les a Die or Skirrs a Card.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, nothing. All Projects are confounded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did your Father leave you nothing but wit to live upon for this? And did hee leave you that but for yeares, and not for Life? and is the terme ex∣pir'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold thy peace. I am casting for something to be done by me, that shall be worth, and cost my life, to shame my Unkle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wat.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a plot! Think of your poore whore Sir,

how shall she live, if you cast away your selfe?</P>

I never whipt it but once, and then it was sweete too, and sprawl'd but a little, and whimper'd but a little it was so sweet a child; And so shee grew upwards, and upwards towards wo∣man, and a sweet youngling shee was, and so grew up∣wards and upwards towards man, and then a sweete Bride shee was, and now a most sweet Lady shee is, (as you say, and I commend you for it) And so she stands at a stay.

<P>Have you ever heard so queint a Love Letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady, the injury done in it, to your selfe is un∣answerable, but my wrong in being his Messenger, I will make him answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cros.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me Sir, he has done me a favour; I pray informe him so with my great thankes. But for what you conceive a wrong to your selfe, use your discretion, you have no more to say to me for him at this present, have you sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for him but against him, I will un say all that I sayd before intended for his good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cros.</SPEAKER>
<P>But i'le not heare you wrong your former love, and judgement of him so, which made so deepe impres∣sion here, that I had lock'd his love up as a Jewell in my Breast, and you in striving now to wrest it thence may breake the Cabinet; I rather wish you'l be a friend∣ly meanes to draw his presence hither, that I my self may mildly question him.</P>

<P>Are you serious Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cros.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feare I shall not rest before I see him, but doe not tell him that, lest in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullen humour, hee force his absence to afflict mee more; I'le hold you sir no lon∣ger, deale for me as you can, I know you have a guesse at my desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le doe you service in it.</P>
<STAGE>Exit Crostill.</STAGE>
<P>I guesse that her desire is to doe some act of Revenge upon him. And (so it be not mortall) it were but Ju∣stice in her for so grosse a scorne by him cast upon a well reputed Gentleman. Yet is it observ'd in her that shee has a violent humour to do, and not to doe things often∣times wilfully against all good councell or perswasion, shee has the spirit of contradiction in her, and an unal∣terable resolution upon sodaine intentions, a most incor∣rigible will shee has that will not bow nor breake. This crosse abusive Letter therefore may doe good upon her,
<PB REF="28"/>
however mischievous hee might intend it. If shee meant well to him before, it may the faster bring her on, but it amazes me that hee should write so, bearing his Unkle, and my selfe in hand, that hee so fairely lov'd her, and besought us to negotiate with her for him, should shee forgive it, yet the wrong to us in his vile manners is un∣pardonable, and so sir, I come to you.</P>

<PB REF="143"/>
your projects are put down, and you'l take up no new: but what shall be (spectators) to please you. And you Poetick part induces you, t'appologize now for the Poet too, as they ha' done already, you to the Ladies, you to the Cavaliers and Gentry; you to the City friend, and all for the Poet, Poet, Poet, when alls but begging tho. I'le speak to 'em all, and to my Countrey folkes too if here be any o'em: and yet not beg for the Poet tho', why should we? has not he money for his doings? and the best price too? because we would ha' the best: And if it be not, why so? The Poet has shewd his wit and we our man∣ners. But to stand beg, beg for reputation for one that has no countenance to carry it, and must ha' money is such a Pastime!—If it were for one of the great and curious Poets that give these Playes as the Prologue said, and mo∣ney too, to have 'em acted; For them, indeed, we are bound to ply for an applause. Because they look for no∣thing else, and scorn to beg for themselves. But then you'l say those Playes are not given to you; you pay as much for your seats at them as at these, though you sit nere the merrier, nor rise the wiser, they are so above common understanding; and tho' you see for your love you will judge for your money, why so for that too, you may. But take heed you displease not the Ladies tho' who are their partiall judges, being brib'd by flattering verses to commend their Playes; for whose faire cause, and by their powerfull voyces to be cry'd up wits o' Court, the right worshipfull Poets boast to have made those enter∣ludes, when for ought you know they bought 'em of Uni∣versitie Scholars tho', and onely shew their own wits in owning other mens; and that but as they are like neither. As thus, do you like that Song? yes▪ I made it. Is that Scene or that Jest good? Yes, Twas mine; and then if all be good 'twas all mine. There's wit in that now. But this small Poet vents none but his own, and his by whose care
<PB REF="144"/>
and directions this Stage is govern'd, who has for many yeares both in his fathers dayes, and since directed Poets to write &amp; Players to speak, till he traind up these youths here to what they are now. I some of 'em from before they were able to say a grace of two lines long to have more parts in their pates then would fill so many Dry∣fats. And to be serious with you, if after all this, by the venemous practise of some, who study nothing more then his destruction, he should faile us, both Poets and Players would be at losse in Reputation. But this is from our Poet agen, who tels you plainly all the helps he has or desires; And let me tell you he has made prety merry Jigges that ha' pleas'd a many. As (le'me see) th' <HI>Anti∣podes,</HI> and (oh I shall never forget) <HI>Tom Hoyden</HI> o' <HI>Tanton Deans.</HI> Hee'l bring him hither very shortly in a new Motion, and in a new paire o' slops and new nether stocks as briske as a Body-lowse in a new Pasture.</P>

it) And as I said, when I perceiv'd he began to melt, and that every stranger abused him; I, having some wit, fell too, and most cozen'd him my self. I look'd for my daughters good: And so betwixt us, found the trick to get, or steale from him two Jewells of good deep value, being indeed the main of his rest of Fortune. Now Sir, I come to you.</P>
