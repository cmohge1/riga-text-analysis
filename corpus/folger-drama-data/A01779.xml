<L>YOu need not feare me Gentlemen, although</L>
<L>I come thus arm'd; tis but to let you know</L>
<L>I am in office; in my owne defence,</L>
<L>And to secure me from the violence,</L>
<L>Which might from you (who now my Iudges sit)</L>
<L>Be off'red to this Trophee of my wit:</L>
<L>And cause I know that you will obay</L>
<L>Authority, I doe charge you, like the Play:</L>
<L>Thinke who I am, how often I may catch</L>
<L>You at ill houres in Tavernes, or ith' Watch;</L>
<L>In Fraies sometimes; nay sometimes (not to trench</L>
<L>Too much upon you) with a pretty wench.</L>
<L>All this is possible, and Gentlemen,</L>
<L>Consider how my rage will use you then,</L>
<L>If you should now, as sure tis worth your feare,</L>
<L>Be in the censure of my wit seuere,</L>
<L>Vext I' me implacable; and though the Tribe</L>
<L>Of Constables doe us't, Ile take no bribe</L>
<L>To let you passe: These sturdy knaves will take</L>
<L>Not the least mercy on you for my sake:</L>
<L>Nor will the Iustice free you: (to your smart)</L>
<L>You'le find, he and his Clarke will take my part.</L>
<L>I can but gently warne you to prevent</L>
<L>A danger, nay a certaine punishment,</L>
<L>Should you dislike: for if the Play doe fall</L>
<L>Vnder your votes, Ile apprehend you all.</L>
