<L>Ech in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unction seruing others need,</L>
<L>I was a Courtier in the Spanish Court.</L>
<L>My name was <HI>Don Andrea,</HI> my discent</L>
<L>Though not ignoble, yet inferiour far</L>
<L>To gratious fortunes of my tender youth:</L>
<L>For there in prime and pride of all my yeeres,</L>
<L>By duteous seruice and deseruing loue,</L>
<L>In secret I pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est a wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy dame,</L>
<L>Which hight sweet <HI>Bel-imperia</HI> by name.</L>
<L>But in the haruest of my sommer ioyes,</L>
<L>Deaths winter nipt the blossomes of my blisse,</L>
<L>Forcing diuorce betwixt my loue and me.</L>
<L>For in the late conflict with Portingale,</L>
<L>My valour drew me into dangers mouth,</L>
<L>Till life to death made passage through my wounds.</L>
<L>When I was slaine, my soule descended straight,</L>
<L>To passe the flowing streame of Acheron:</L>
<L>But churlish <HI>Charon</HI> only boatman there,</L>
<L>Said that my rites of buriall not performde,</L>
<L>I might not sit amongst his passengers.</L>
<L>Ere <HI>Sol</HI> had slept three nights in <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> lap,</L>

<L>Drew forth the manner of my life and death.</L>
<L>This knight (quoth he) both liu'd and died in loue:</L>
<L>And for his loue tried fortune of the warres,</L>

<L>No, no, said <HI>Rhadamant,</HI> it were not well,</L>
<L>With louing soules to place a Martialist,</L>
<L>He died in warre, and must to martiall fields:</L>

<L>And <HI>Achilles</HI> mermedons do scoure the plaine.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Minos</HI> mildest censor of the three,</L>

<L>To this effect my pasport straight was drawne.</L>
<L>In keeping on my way to <HI>Plutos</HI> Court,</L>
<L>Through dreadfull shades of euer glooming night:</L>
<L>I saw more sights then thousand tongues can tell,</L>
<L>Or pennes can write, or mortall harts can think.</L>
<L>Three waies there were, that on the right hand side,</L>

<L>The left hand path declining fearfully,</L>

<L>Where bloudie furies shakes their whips of steele,</L>

<L>This is an argument for our Viceroy,</L>
