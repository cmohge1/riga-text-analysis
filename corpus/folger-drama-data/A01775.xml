<L>I'me sorry that</L>
<L>You for whose head the gratitude of the state</L>

<L>To stand here a delinquent, but the law</L>
<L>Must as a streight and uncorrupted streame</L>

<L>We are not met here to arraigne a prisoner,</L>

<L>Yet this brave youth,</L>

<L>His blood and titles, his defensive bayes</L>
<L><PB REF="25"/>
(That would have guarded his victorious front</L>
<L>From blasts of lightning) laid aside, is come</L>
<L>To tender satisfaction to the lawes,</L>
<L>He has offended, and since judgement is</L>
<L>The immediate act of Justice, it must passe</L>
<L>To save impartiall censure on his life,</L>
<L>As on the wretched'st malefactors; for</L>
<L>His former merits cannot take away</L>
<L>His present fault; for who ere is guilty</L>
<L>Vndoes the priviledge of his desert and blood;</L>
<L>For if great men offending passe unpunish'd,</L>
<L>The common people who doe use to sinne,</L>
<L>By their example fearelesse, will runne on</L>

<L>Yet my good Lords,</L>
<L>I speake not this, that my particular vengeance,</L>
<L>Because slew he my kinsman, has the least</L>
<L>Ayme at his life, which I would strive to cherish</L>
<L>As my owne health, or as the Cities peace,</L>
<L>For Magistrates ought to behold their crimes,</L>
<L>Not the committers, as the Poets faine</L>
<L>Of wise <HI>Tyresias,</HI> to want eyes, and only</L>
<L>Have seeing understanding, for a judge</L>
<L>Is guilty of the fault he does not punish,</L>
<L>And if rewards and triumphs doe adorne</L>
<L>Deserts tis just that shame and punishments</L>
<L>Should wait on vices, and how much more worthy</L>
<L>The person is that acts them, so farre sharper</L>
<L>Should be the penalty inflicted on him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sen.</SPEAKER>
<L>And when the law</L>

<L>In briefe We must</L>

<L>My Lords,</L>

<L>A fame surviving which I would be loath,</L>
<L>Should tell posterity I tamely yeelded</L>
<L>My head to th' Axe, and dyed because my spirit</L>
<L>Durst not desire to live to quit this scandall,</L>

<L>A thousand showers of sorrow, could this hand</L>
<L>Reedifie that goodly from of flesh</L>
<L>Which it demolisht, but my pricelesse fame,</L>

<L>Boldly proclaime, <HI>I</HI> did no more then what</L>
<L>The truth <HI>I</HI> owe my reputation tells me,</L>

<SPEAKER>Tri.</SPEAKER>
<L>But the law</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your lawes cannot without partiality pronounce</L>
<L>Iudgement against me, for they doo acquit</L>
<L>That man of guilt that to defend his life</L>
<L>Is forc'd to slay his enemy; my act</L>
<L><PB REF="26"/>
Carries the same condition, since my fame,</L>
<L>Whose safety urg'd me to kill him, is my life,</L>
<L>My immortall life, as farre transcending this</L>
<L>As the soule does the body, for the sword,</L>
<L>Returnes that to its primitive matter dust,</L>
<L>And there it rests forgotten, but a wound</L>
<L>Strucke upon reputation, leaves a brand,</L>
<L>So selfe diffusive is dishonors guilt,</L>
<L>Even to posterity, and does revive</L>
<L>After t'has sufferd martyrdome.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet this</L>
<L>Cannot excuse your fact, for civill reason</L>
<L>Allowes a reparation for the losse</L>

<L>To snatch the priviledge from the hands of justice,</L>

<L>This strictnesse destroyes all</L>
