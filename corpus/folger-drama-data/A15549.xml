<P>I wil be askt ith Church of Sunday at morning prayer, and againe at Euening prayer: &amp; the next holiday that comes I will be askt ith forenoone, and married ith afternoone: For (do you marke) I am none of these sneaking fellowes that wil stand thrumming of Caps, and studying vppon a matter, as long as <HI>Hunkes</HI> with the great head has beene a∣bout to show his little wit in the second part of his paultrie poetrie: but if I begin with wooing, Ile ende with wed∣ding.</P>
<P>And therefore good <HI>Clearke,</HI> let me haue it done with all speede: for I promise you, I am verie sharpe set.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cleark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith you may be askt ith Church on Sunday at morning prayer, but Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> cannot tend to do it at Eue∣ning prayer: For there comes a Company of Players tuth Towne, on Sunday ith after noone; and Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> is so good a fellow, that I know heele scarce leaue their companie, to say Euening prayer.</P>
<P>For (though I say it) hees a verie paineful man, and takes so great delight in that facultie, that heele take as great paine a∣bout

<P>Why <HI>William,</HI> what company doe you meane to haue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marrie, first and for most, there wil bee an honest Dutch Cobbler, that wil sing (I wil noe meare to <HI>Burgaine</HI> goe) the best that euer you heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ploddall.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, must a Cobbler be your chiefe guest? Why hees a basefellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>A basefellow? you may be asham'd to say so,</P>
<P>For hees an honestfellow, and a goodfellow:</P>
<P>And he begins to carrie the verie badge of good fellowship vpon his nose; that I do not doubt, but in time he wil prooue as good a Copper companion as <HI>Robin Goodfellowe</HI> him∣selfe.</P>
<P>I and hees a tallfellow, and a man of his hands too,</P>
<P>For Ile tel you what: tie him tuth Bull-Ring, and for a bag∣pudding, a Custard, a Cheescake, a hogges cheeke, or a Calues head, turne any man ith towne to him; and if he do not prooue himselfe as tall a man as he, let blind <HI>Hugh</HI> be∣witch him, and tourne his bodie, into a barrel of strong Ale, and let his nose be the Spigat, his mouth the Fosset, and his tongue a Plugge for the bunge hole.</P>
<P>And then there wil be <HI>Robin Goodfellow,</HI> as good a drunken rogue as liues: and <HI>Tom</HI> Shoomaker; and I hope you wil not deny that hees an honest man, for hee was Constable oth Towne.</P>
<P>And a number of other honest rascals, which though they
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>
are growne bankroutes and liue by the reuersion of other mens tables:</P>
<P>Yet (thankes bee to God) they haue a penny amongst, at all times at their neede.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ploddall.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, if <HI>Robin Goodfellow</HI> be there, you shall be sure to haue our company.</L>
<L>For hees one that we heare very well of;</L>
<L>And my sonne here has some occasion to vse him:</L>
<L>And therefore if we may know when tis, weele make bolde to trouble you.</L>

<L>Whose craftie braine beguiles my father so,</L>
<L>That he reposeth trust in none but him:</L>
<L>And though he seekes for fauour at my hands,</L>
<L>He takes his marke amisse and shootes awrie.</L>
<L>For I had rather see the diuel himselfe,</L>

<L>When most you did expect a sunneshine day,</L>
<L>My fathers will would mar your hop't for hay,</L>
<L>And when you thought to reap the fruits of loue,</L>
