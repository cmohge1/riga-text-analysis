patience? Then will I be made an <HI>Eunuch,</HI> and learne to sing
Ballads. I doe not deny, but my father may haue as much pa∣tience
as any other man; for hee vses to take phisicke, and oft
taking phisicke, makes a man a very patient creature. But,
Signior <HI>Prospero,</HI> had your swaggering <HI>Epistle</HI> here, arriued in

any other nutriment, in the world, for the space of one and
twentie weekes, but Tabacco onely. Therefore it cannot be but
'tis most diuine. Further, take it in the nature, in the true kinde
so, it makes an Antidote, that (had you taken the most de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly
