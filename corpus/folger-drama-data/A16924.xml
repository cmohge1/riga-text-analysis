not, had he beene Kinsman to the Emperour, and my Enemy.
Therefore in I went, told Master <HI>Tridewell</HI> in his eare, my
comming was to call him forth, to dischardge the office of
a Gentleman with his Sword, in answering those wrongs
wherewith I held my reputation wounded. Was it not
well, ha? Could a poore Gentleman say more? and that in
ciuill fashion very priuately in respect of the company,
not shewing any the least distemper, in looke or gesture.
But the Women read presently in his countenance the
whole matter; and briefly by their pretty perswasion I
tooke ordinary satisfaction of him.</P>
