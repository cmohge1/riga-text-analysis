Grace the last sacri∣fice
of this nature
that is in my power,
having only a hope
that it may be re∣ceiv'd
by You with that favour as
when it was formerly presented. And
so, Madam, I only dare to appear in
an address to You, as others to their
Altars, who by sacrifices get pardon
for their defects, if not advance their
devotions. This was to your Sex in∣deed
<PB REF="2"/>
a peculiar offering, whilst all
either gave as much Passion to their
Adorers, or wisht their Beauties great
enough to do it: your Graces excel∣lencies
alone have been by all admi∣rers
esteem'd at so great and just a va∣lue,
as to create, and not reward mens
passions. This with as just a reverence
I present to you, hoping for this Ro∣mantique
passion such an entertain∣ment
as none durst expect for real
ones; your severity would deny a
reception to those, which your cha∣rity
may grant to this: And believe,
he that attempts all ways to express
his respects and duty, has more then
Fortune will give him leave to shew,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cleon.</SPEAKER>
<L>The present affairs, sir, of this Kingdom</L>
<L>Call for a man both wise and valiant:</L>
<L>Such I must say you are; nor is this needful truth</L>
<L>Thus timely urged, to be esteemed a flattery,</L>
<L>Though spoken to your self. Your father, sir, was
what you are;</L>
<L>But now time and infirmities have brought him</L>
<L>Near to what we truly might call dotage</L>
<L>In a meaner man. And is it reasonable</L>
<L>You should stand by an idle looker on,</L>
<L>Whilst his weak or false Councellors and he</L>
<L>Make peace or war with foreign States,</L>
<L>Dispose of government and Offices at home,</L>
<L>Not on the best deserver, but the greatest briber,</L>
<L>Or such a Lords particular friend or kinsman.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Truth is, I do appear now at home of no</L>
<L>esteem:</L>

<L>By my sweat and blood, no one of their Ambassadors</L>
<L>Makes any particular address to me.</L>

<L>Another end besides her personal worth,</L>
<L>Which makes him court her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Age.</SPEAKER>
<L>What end?</L>
</SP>

<L>You know, sir, at least must needs have heare</L>
<L>Her ancestors have been pretenders, to this Crown,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Age.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis true, hardly where right;</L>
<L>But a pretension not then prosperous,</L>
<L>Neither lives but to shame the undertakers memory</L>
<L>But were it otherwise in this particular,</L>
<L>I durst trust my brother, indeed in any,</L>
<L>For I know his love to me is firm.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Sir, 'tis a noble confidence in you,</L>
<L>Nor would I seek to change that quiet peace</L>
<L>That lodges in your mind, for a worse guest, suspition</L>
<L>But if I do not freely speak my fears,</L>
<L>I shall be guilty of a treason to my Prince</L>
<L>And friend. Your brother sir, fosters ambitious hopes</L>
<L>And howsoe'r you slight <HI>Clorinda's</HI> title,</L>
<L>That is their chiefest nourishment.</L>
</SP>

<L>It is impossible.</L>

<L>Especially such men as the King <HI>Agenor</HI></L>
<L>And his more worthy brother <HI>Clarimant.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olind.</SPEAKER>
<L>These words of <HI>Clarimant,</HI> if heard,</L>
<L>Would cause a general joy through all the Court:</L>
<L>But he himself must know his happiness by degrees,</L>
<L>Lest the excess again disturb his health;</L>
<L>Since your last visit he is miraculously recover'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>You attribute to me what is more justly due</L>
<L>Unto the King and Queen's, nay your sweet con∣versation.</L>
<L>Methinks you four would be most aptly join'd;</L>
<L>Two brothers and two sisters, whose perfections</L>
<L>All the world cannot equal.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olind.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear <HI>Clorinda,</HI> I must not understand you;</L>
<L>Or if I do, you have a mean opinion</L>
<L>Of my Judgment, less of my Constancie,</L>
<L>Which did but now profess my heart for ever only
yours:</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>I take for granted that your heart is mine,</L>
<L>Which I express in that I would dispose it,</L>
<L>And so I would do my own, if I had any:</L>
<L>But know that what I once do give I never reassume;</L>
<L>Or if I had a heart, could that be worthy <HI>Clarimant</HI></L>
<L>Another had despised?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olind.</SPEAKER>
<L>What now you speak to me, expresses your
respect to him,</L>
<L>And so must not displease; for I confess</L>
<L>His merits are so great, that in his happiness</L>
<L>All that love vertue must be sharers:</L>
<L>But I beseech you do not entertain a thought</L>
<L>That you can breed a change in him or me.</L>
<L>Dear <HI>Clorinda,</HI> your vertue and your beauty</L>
<L>Is the object of our Loves; such a conformity</L>
<L>As may arise from that, betwixt Prince <HI>Clarimant</HI></L>
<L>And me, is only fit.</L>

<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>I for my part do ask no more, but that your
lines</L>
<L>Of love do meet in me: But reason in him,</L>
<L>Friendship in you may give me power in time</L>
<L>To tie a happy knot; this hope the Gods inspire me with.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olind.</SPEAKER>
<L>Take heed, they needs must be offended
with you</L>

<L>But do not hope it, when two wills oppose you.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet when the Gods shall give their sentence,</L>
<L>Your will and <HI>Clarimant's,</HI> it all your vows be true,</L>
<L>Must then submit to mine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olind.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should we grant our obedience, how have
the Gods,</L>
<L>Or can they unto us declare their will?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<L>That great Deity that did infuse</L>
<L>A reasonable soul into us mortals,</L>
<L>Inthron'd that Reason as a King to govern</L>
<L>All our actions. But beyond this I am inform'd,</L>
<L>Nor is it possible but you must know it,</L>
<L>That here without the City in a sacred Grove,</L>
<L>There lives a man so pious, and so knowing</L>
<L>The will of heaven, that all men in distress</L>
<L>Or doubt repair to him, and find a happy issue</L>
<L>Of their troubles.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olind.</SPEAKER>
<L>It is most true, his fame is great:</L>
<L>If curiosity do move you to go visit him,</L>
<L>I gladly will attend you; but since I have resisted</L>
<L>What you commanded, dear <HI>Clorinda,</HI></L>
<L>No mortal man must change me.</L>

<L>Faith sir, his outward wounds are pretty

a cause</L>

<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld you think so? his action was
not such</L>
<L>As you would make it; although <HI>Clorinda</HI></L>
<L>Were a woman, he knew it not, but as a rival</L>

<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<L>That is true, sir; it is not that which I alleadg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>In his disgrace, but that he with such odds</L>
<L>Could not defend himself from <HI>Clarimant.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<L>It was his misfortune, and not want of courage,</L>
<L><PB N="131" REF="68"/>
Nor can I think that he consented</L>
<L>To that assistance which his servants gave:</L>
<L>However I must value him a friend,</L>
<L>For such he shewed himself in my distress;</L>
<L>Nor shall he suffer in my Kingdom, if it lie</L>
<L>In my power to serve him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Au.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am not, sir, to counsel you: but for my part</L>
<L>The little knowledg I had of him, does make me wish</L>
<L>Never to see my sister married to him;</L>
<L>And I am confident, if not inforc'd,</L>
<L>She never will receive him for a husband.</L>
</SP>

<L>It is not come to that: I rather fear</L>
<L>His wounds were mortal; and should he thus be lost</L>

<HEAD>Epilogue.</HEAD>
<L>FIrst, Ladies, unto you I am addrest;</L>
<L>As those who judge of Lovers actions best:</L>
<L>If <HI>Clarimant</HI> your suffrages hath gain'd,</L>
<L>Our Author hath his chiefest end obtain'd:</L>
<L>Now Sirs to you—</L>
<L>Sure here's no Lover will <HI>Clorinda</HI> blame</L>
<L>For gratitude, since you must hope the same:</L>
<L>Perhaps you rather think she was too nice,</L>
<L>That such a flame no sooner thaw'd her ice:</L>
<L>Our Author hopes she did but her just part;</L>
<L>He nobly woo'd, she timely gave her heart:</L>
<L>To both the sexes we prefer this sute;</L>
<L>Ere you give sentence, with your selves dispute:</L>
<L>If then condemn'd, to whom should we appeal,</L>
<L>But to that Prince that pardons faults of zeal?</L>
<L>If then condemn'd, 'twere pride to make appeal,</L>
<L>Yet there remains a pardon in our zeal:</L>
